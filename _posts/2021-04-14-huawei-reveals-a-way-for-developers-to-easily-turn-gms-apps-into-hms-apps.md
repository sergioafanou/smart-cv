<li>Huawei has announced the availability of a solution to turn existing GMS apps into HMS apps.</li>
<li>The Choice SDK has already been used to make a variety of apps available on the AppGallery.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-phones-computers-more-1160873/">Huawei</a>&#8216;s recent phones all lack Google Mobile Services (GMS), forcing the Chinese manufacturer to come up with its own <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-mobile-services-hms-1086979/">Huawei Mobile Services</a> (HMS) suite as an alternative. One side-effect is that apps with GMS integration (i.e. using Google services for notifications, mapping, location etc) either don&#8217;t work properly or at all on these recent Huawei devices.</p>
<p>Now, Huawei has announced the availability of an open-source solution called Choice SDK. This solution essentially turns existing GMS apps into HMS apps, saving app developers time and resources. According to the <a href="https://github.com/bluesource/ChoiceSDK" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SDK&#8217;s GitHub page</a>, the solution currently supports features like location, sign-in, analytics, maps, and messaging.</p>
<p>The SDK was originally developed to help make an Austrian bank app (Raiffeisen Bank) available to Huawei device users. But developer BlueSource adds that Austria&#8217;s national TV broadcaster, railway service, postal service, and a local deals app have all used this solution to bring their apps to Huawei&#8217;s <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-app-gallery-review-1101306/">AppGallery</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a rather interesting and nifty approach to the issue of GMS apps working on Huawei devices, and should theoretically mean less development work for studios. It doesn&#8217;t seem like a one-click process though, so there&#8217;s still some measure of work that needs to be done by developers. In any event, Huawei and BlueSource told <em>Android Authority</em> that developers can deliver HMS support twice as fast using this tool compared to standard methods of enabling HMS in an app.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t sound like end-users can convert their favorite GMS-enabled apps to run on Huawei&#8217;s HMS devices though. Still, this is a welcome development as the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-google-android-ban-988382/">US trade ban against Huawei</a> doesn&#8217;t look like it will end soon.</p>
