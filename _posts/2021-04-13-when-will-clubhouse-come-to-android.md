<li>It has already been in development for weeks.</li>

<p>Clubhouse has been all the rage in tech circles, with big names <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/bill-gates-android-clubhouse-1204209/">like Bill Gates</a> and Elon Musk using the drop-in audio chat to offer insights. But when is Clubhouse coming to Android? You might not have to wait long — as <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/12/clubhouse-android-development/"><em>9to5Google</em></a> reports, a release date for the Android app might be just around the corner.</p>
<p>Morgan Evetts has <a href="https://twitter.com/morqon/status/1381340850505060354">learned</a> that Clubhouse developer Mopewa Ogundipe and her colleagues have been <a href="https://twitter.com/mopewa_o/status/1381300360304820226">working</a> on the Android app for &#8220;around six weeks,&#8221; and that it&#8217;s tentatively due for release in May. We wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the timing slipped due to the hiccups that often occur in development, but you might only have to wait a few weeks to give this a try.</p>

<p>Clubhouse cofounder Paul Davidson had previously hinted that an Android app was just a matter of time.  He considered it a high priority, and saw it as key to expanding the chat platform&#8217;s reach worldwide.</p>
<p>The platform&#8217;s invitation-based, iPhone-only limitation has added to its cachet, particularly in Silicon Valley&#8217;s startup culture. There&#8217;s little doubt that an Android version of Clubhouse is virtually necessary, though. Android is usually the dominant mobile operating system outside of North America, and many people can&#8217;t justify <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/iphone-buying-guide-1040587/">iPhone-level</a> premium pricing. A release for Google-powered devices could make the app far more accessible and elevate it beyond its current niche status.</p>
