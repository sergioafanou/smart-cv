The creepiness factor notwithstanding, they'll regale audiences and journalists about what a near-magical state that would be, to not have a cumbersome obstacle -- specifically, a phone -- that sits between your mind and whatever action you&rsquo;re trying to take, or thought you&rsquo;re trying to communicate. Especially given the massive <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/04/03/facebook-data-leak-533-million-user-records-leaked-online/">Facebook data leak</a> that was disclosed over the weekend, I'm not sure how many of us would want to give Zuckerberg a direct hook-up to our brain, but this is all nevertheless indicative of growing scientific interest in essentially "reading" more of peoples' brains -- for a whole host of reasons.</p>
<p>The latest news from scientists out of Caltech, for example, shows how some particularly exciting advancements can be made in this area, after utilizing a familiar piece of technology, no less. A collaboration at Caltech has resulted in the development of what the university calls a "minimally invasive BMI" (for brain-machine interface), that promises the ability to <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/reading-minds-with-ultrasound-caltechs-new-brain-machine-interface/">"read" brain activity</a> that corresponds to planned movements by the subject being studied. "Using functional ultrasound technology, it can accurately map brain activity from precise regions deep within the brain at a resolution of 100 micrometers," a Caltech announcement explains.</p>
