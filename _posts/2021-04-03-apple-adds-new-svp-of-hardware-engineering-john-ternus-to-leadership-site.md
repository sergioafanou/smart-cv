Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/25/dan-riccio-transitioning-new-project/">in January announced</a> that former Hardware Engineering SVP Dan Riccio was transitioning to a new role to focus on an unspecified project, and that Ternus would take over.
<br/>

<br/>
Riccio has been removed from the executive page as he's now a vice president of engineering, and while Apple has not said what he's working on, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/08/dan-riccio-ar-vr-headsets-focus/">recently said</a> that he is focusing on Apple's AR/VR headsets.
<br/>

<br/>
John Ternus initially joined Apple as part of the Product Design team in 2001, and has been a vice president of Hardware Engineering since 2013. From his biography on the leadership page:<blockquote>John Ternus is Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Engineering, reporting to CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>. John leads all hardware engineering, including the teams behind <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, Mac, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/">AirPods</a>, and more.
<br/>

<br/>

Throughout his tenure at Apple, John has overseen hardware engineering work on a variety of groundbreaking products including every generation and model of &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, the latest &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup, and &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj;.
