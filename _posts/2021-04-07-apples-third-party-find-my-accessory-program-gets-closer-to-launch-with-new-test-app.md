Apple is getting closer to launching the third-party program that will allow item trackers and other Bluetooth devices to be tracked using the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a> app, based on the launch of a new app.

As noted by <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/apple-launches-an-app-for-testing-devices-that-work-with-find-my-signaling-third-party-device-program-will-soon-go-live/?tpcc=ECTW2020">TechCrunch</a></em>, Apple Sunday introduced the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/find-my-certification-asst/id1532296125">Find My Certification Asst. app</a>, which was created exclusively for Made for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> (MFi) licensees who need to test their accessories with the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network. From the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> description:
<br/>
<blockquote>For use by MFi Licensees only. Use the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; Certification Assistant to test discovery, connection, and other key requirements for accessories you develop that incorporate &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network technology.</blockquote>Based on screenshots of the app, product developers are able to test connectivity, sound power, NFC capabilities, firmware, Bluetooth connectivity, and more.

<br/>
Apple's &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; Network Accessory Program was first introduced alongside iOS and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/">iPadOS 14</a>. It lets third-party products integrate with the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app, allowing them to be tracked right alongside Apple devices.

<br/>
iOS 14.5 added a new "Items" tab to the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app, which is where any &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; integrated device will be able to be tracked. This is also presumably where Apple's own <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags</a> will be able to be located when those launch, but for now, it may be aimed at third-party accessories.
<br/>

<br/>
So far, there are few accessory makers that have released a product that works with &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; integration. Belkin <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/11/belkin-magsafe-charger-find-my-earbuds/">in January announced</a> the Soundform Freedom True Wireless Earbuds, which have &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; integration and will be able to be tracked in the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app.
<br/>

<br/>
&zwnj;Find My&zwnj; is able to work with any device that has Bluetooth and integrates Apple's code through the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; Network Accessory Program, so it is not limited to item trackers and can be built into any Bluetooth product. Tile has been offering a similar program that allows accessories to integrate with the Tile ecosystem to be located through the Tile app.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/06/find-my-accessory-program-test-app/">Apple&#039;s Third-Party Find My Accessory Program Gets Closer to Launch With New Test App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-third-party-find-my-accessory-program-gets-closer-to-launch-with-new-test-app.2290820/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
