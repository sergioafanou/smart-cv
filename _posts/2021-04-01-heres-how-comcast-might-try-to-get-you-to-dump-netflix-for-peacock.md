It should come as no surprise that Comcast would be considering such a move, because while those services have to pay to license Universal Pictures movies, Peacock subscription numbers might take precedence.</p>
<p>As <em>Bloomberg</em> notes, HBO Max currently pays NBCUniversal for the rights to show Universal Pictures movies around nine months after the end of their theatrical runs. Netflix has a similar deal in place for animated films from film studio Illumination, which is behind <em>The Secret Life of Pets</em>, <em>Despicable Me</em>, and an upcoming Mario movie. The deals both expire at the end of 2021, which is why Comcast is weighing its options now.</p>
