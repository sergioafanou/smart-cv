In December, when the announcement was made, we still weren't sure what the world would look like by the end of 2021 or how long it would take for theaters to fully open back up again. Five months later, the US is now vaccinating more than 3 million eligible adults a day, and so it comes as no surprise that Warner's experiment will end this year.</p>
<p>Speaking with Peter Kafka <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/4/8/22372626/warnermedia-ceo-jason-kilar-hbo-max-movies-streaming-interview-peter-kafka">on a recent episode of Vox's Recode Media podcast</a>, WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar said that big, blockbuster movies will go exclusively to theaters again first next year before streaming.</p>
