The passionate love story between the Duke of Hastings (Reg&eacute;-Jean Page) and Daphne Bridgerton (Phoebe Dynevor) is set against the backdrop of a more progressive Regency-era, and it is beloved by so many fans.</p>
<p>The first bad <em>Bridgerton</em> news <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/02/17/bridgerton-season-2-spoilers-lead-characters/">dropped in mid-February</a>. <em>Bridgerton</em> will get a second season on Netflix, but the newlyweds will not be the main characters of the upcoming romantic entanglements. It&rsquo;s not going to be Simon &ldquo;burning&rdquo; for Daphne in season 2, as the action will focus on a different Bridgerton sibling, Anthony (Jonathan Bailey). That comes straight from the showrunners, who have also announced the actress set to play Anthony&rsquo;s new love interest. At the time, we noted that Page and Dynevor would likely take a backseat, but we&rsquo;ll still get glimpses at their relationship.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a new development on the matter that <em>Bridgerton</em> fans will absolutely hate &mdash; but Page fans who also follow the MCU closely might have a reason to be excited about this unfortunate <em>Bridgerton</em> revelation.</p>
