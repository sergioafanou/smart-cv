<ul>
<li>Google has released Android 12 Developer Preview 2.2.</li>
<li>The update fixes Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and widget bugs.</li>
<li>It also includes April security fixes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Google has shared yet another small but noteworthy <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-12-review-1201890/">Android 12 Developer Preview</a> revision ahead of a third milestone. <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/07/android-12-developer-preview-2-2/"><em>9to5Google</em></a> reports that the company has <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/release-notes#dp2.2">released</a> Android 12 DP2.2 with a host of important fixes for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and security.</p>
<p>This latest Android 12 DP2 update provides a fix for crashes when you try to access Bluetooth settings, and eliminates false warnings about poor Bluetooth call quality. DP2.2 also addresses a bug that would prevent Android from saving Wi-Fi passwords.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-12-features-1195735/">Every Android 12 feature confirmed and rumored</a></p>
<p>This DP2 update also brings the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/april-2021-android-security-patch-1215208/">April 2021 security patch</a> to Android 12. You won&#8217;t see huge changes as a result, but it will keep your device more secure while you&#8217;re using Google&#8217;s pre-release software.</p>
<p>Other improvements in the Android 12 DP2 update tackle annoyances. Widgets are no longer prone to disappearing when you install an over-the-air update. The on-screen keyboard won&#8217;t risk activating the notification shade. Shared videos will now encode correctly, and Codec 2.0 shouldn&#8217;t crash apps on some hardware.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-2-developer-preview-2-1-fixes-webview-app-crashes-1213243/">with DP2.1</a>, the 2.2 update is really more of a stopgap solution until Android 12 Developer Preview 3 arrives later in April. You&#8217;ll also want to avoid using this on your main phone or any other must-have device. This is meant for app makers who want to get titles ready for Android 12. You&#8217;ll likely want to wait until at least the first public Android 12 beta (due in May) if you&#8217;re an everyday user, and you may still see significant bugs until the finished version is ready later in 2021.</p>
