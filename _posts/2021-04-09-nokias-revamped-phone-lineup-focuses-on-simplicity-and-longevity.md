<li>HMD Global has overhauled the Nokia phone line to include just three series: X, G, and C.</li>
<li>All three promise long battery life and years of Android updates, but they&#8217;re all budget-oriented.</li>
<li>They&#8217;ll be available in the UK starting in late April.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&#8217;re confused by <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-nokia-phones-827121/">Nokia&#8217;s phone lineup</a> and its fondness for decimal points, relief is at hand. HMD Global has revamped the Nokia phone range for 2021, and it&#8217;s both considerably simpler and more focused — if not necessarily what you were expecting.</p>
<p>The 2021 Nokia phone roster is divided into just three ranges, all of which center on longevity. The X-series represents the top of the line, with more advanced features, two-day battery life, three years of OS updates (including monthly security updates), and an extended warranty. The mid-range G-series pictured above is meant to be more accessible and promises three-day battery life, two years of OS updates and three years of monthly security fixes. The C-series aims at newcomers with &#8220;all day&#8221; battery and two years of quarterly security updates, although there are no promises for OS upgrades.</p>

<p>The Nokia X10 and X20 (pictured at middle) headline the 2021 models, although they&#8217;re low-to-mid-range phones. Both use 5G-capable <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-1188794/">Snapdragon 480</a> chips and sport 6.67-inch 1,080 x 2,400 displays. The X10 starts things off with a 48MP main camera, a 5MP ultra-wide cam, a 2MP macro cam, a 2MP depth sensor, and an 8MP  hole-punch selfie shooter. You&#8217;ll also get between 4GB and 6GB of RAM, with 64GB to 128GB of expandable storage. Spring for the X20 and you&#8217;ll upgrade to a 64MP main camera, a 32MP front cam, and configurations that scale up to 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.</p>

<p>The Nokia G10 and G20, meanwhile, are decidedly more modest entries to the 2021 line. Both use MediaTek processors (G25 in the G10, G35 in the G20) and revolve around 6.5-inch &#8220;HD+&#8221; screens. The G20 boasts a camera setup similar to the one in the X10, albeit in a teardrop notch for the front cam, while the G10 makes do with a 13MP primary camera and drops the ultra-wide sensor. You&#8217;ll get 4GB of RAM and up to 128GB of expandable space on the G20, but the G10 starts with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage.</p>
<p>The C10 and C20 (below) run Android 11 Go edition and are clearly designed to occupy the no-frills places in Nokia&#8217;s 2021 selection. The displays are largely similar to what you&#8217;ll find in the G-series, but you&#8217;ll get basic Unisoc quad- (C10) and octa-core (C20) chips, 1GB to 2GB of RAM, 16GB or 32GB of expandable storage, and single front and rear 5MP cameras.</p>

<p>You won&#8217;t have to wait too long to buy any of the 2021 Nokia devices, at least in some parts of the world. In the UK, the G10 will arrive first with a late April ship date and a £109.99 price. The G20 appears in May for £129.99. The X20 arrives at the same time starting at £299.99. You&#8217;ll have to wait until early June for the £249.99 X10 (plus a lower-priced variant from Three), although you&#8217;ll also have access to the C20 for just £79. There are no plans to ship the C10 in the UK.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve asked HMD about US availability.</p>
<p>As you might have noticed, none of the 2021 Nokia phones announced so far are high-end devices. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no equivalent to the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nokia-9-pureview-review-962171/">9 PureView</a> or other models that would compete with rival flagships. That&#8217;s not necessarily an issue if you&#8217;re more interested in raw value than speed. However, we&#8217;d add that phones like the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/realme-7-5g-uk-price-release-date-1178901/">Realme 7 5G</a> offer 120Hz displays and other perks for similar money. While Nokia&#8217;s battery life and lengthier support are important considerations, they&#8217;re not the only factors in your purchase.</p>
