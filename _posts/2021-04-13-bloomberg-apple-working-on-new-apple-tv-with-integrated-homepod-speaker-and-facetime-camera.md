Apple is working on a combined <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> speaker that has a camera for video calls through a connected television set, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.

<br/>
From the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-working-on-combined-tv-box-speaker-to-revive-home-efforts">report</a>:
<br/>
<blockquote>The company is working on a product that would combine an &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; set-top box with a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; speaker and include a camera for video conferencing through a connected TV and other smart-home functions, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters.
<br/>

<br/>
The device's other capabilities would include standard &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; box functions like watching video and gaming plus smart speaker uses such as playing music and using Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> digital assistant.</blockquote>Following disappointing sales, Apple discontinued its original high-end &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; in March, leaving many wondering if the company was working on a successor. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>, which launched last year, has been much more popular thanks to its lower price.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple unified its engineering teams for &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; and &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; last year, suggesting an integrated device offering the best of both worlds could be in the offing.
<br/>

<br/>
However, according to today's report, the product's development is still in the early stages, and Apple could choose not to launch the product or change key features. 
<br/>

<br/>
Apple is known to be working on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/01/new-apple-tv-remote-with-find-my/">updated version of the Apple TV</a> that will allegedly have a gaming focus with an updated remote control, a faster processor, and increased storage capacity, although it seems likely that today's report is referencing another potential future product. Signs of the new &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; have been showing up in iOS since January 2020, so we are expecting to see a new &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; launch in 2021.
<br/>

<br/>
Today's report also mentions that Apple is working on a concept for a future &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; design that has an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/homepod-ipad-with-robotic-arm/">iPad connected via a robotic arm</a>, which could follow users around a room during video calls.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/">tvOS 14</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">bloomberg.com</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini">HomePod Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/apple-tv-combined-homepod-camera/">Bloomberg: Apple Working on New Apple TV With Integrated HomePod Speaker and FaceTime Camera</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bloomberg-apple-working-on-new-apple-tv-with-integrated-homepod-speaker-and-facetime-camera.2291423/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
