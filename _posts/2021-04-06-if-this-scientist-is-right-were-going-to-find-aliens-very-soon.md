It used to be a pipe dream to think that we'd be able to spot planets orbiting distant stars but now we know of thousands and thousands of such planets, and we're finding more on a startlingly regular basis. So, the question inevitably becomes when, exactly, will we have enough technological power to actually identify intelligent alien life residing somewhere in space.</p>
<p>Physicist Michio Kaku, world-famous for his best-selling books and appearances on all manner of science programs, believes we're closer than we think. In fact, he believes that we may be just one space telescope launch away from having what we need to spot a distant alien civilization living out their lives somewhere in the galaxy. In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/apr/03/string-theory-michio-kaku-aliens-god-equation-large-hadron-collider">a recent interview with <em>The Guardian</em></a>, Kaku explained that the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope may be the answer.</p>
