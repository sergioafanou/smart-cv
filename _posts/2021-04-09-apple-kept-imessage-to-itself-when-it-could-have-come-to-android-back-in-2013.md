<li>iMessage could have come to Android years ago.</li>
<li>Court documents submitted by Epic and Apple before their antitrust trial reveal that Apple execs never wanted to release iMessage for Android.</li>
</ul>
</div><hr>
<p>New findings reveal that Apple could have launched iMessage for Android years ago but deliberately chose not to do so. Epic&#8217;s antitrust lawsuit against Apple has revealed (via <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/08/epic-accuses-apple-of-using-security-as-a-pretext/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>) that the popular <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-whatsapp-alternative-998134/">messaging service</a> was locked in intentionally by Apple even though it could have been cross-compatible with Android as early as 2013.</p>
<p>Court documents submitted by Epic and Apple ahead of their upcoming trial make it clear that Apple executives were against porting iMessage to Android for competitive reasons.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/dkt-407---epic-findings-of-fact-and-conclusions-of-law-0d19d12c959d.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a deposition</a> by Eddy Cue, Apple&#8217;s Senior VP of Internet Software and Services, the company &#8220;could have made a version on Android that worked with iOS&#8221; such that there would &#8220;have been cross-compatibility with the iOS platform so that users of both platforms would have been able to exchange messages with one another seamlessly.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Craig Federighi, Apple’s Senior VP of Software Engineering and the executive in charge of iOS, said, &#8220;iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2016, when a former Apple employee commented that &#8220;the number one most difficult reason to leave the Apple universe app is iMessage,&#8221;  Phil Schiller, responsible for leading the App Store, commented that &#8220;moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us.&#8221;</p>
<p>These statements reaffirm what most of us have known for a while — Apple likes to keep its ecosystem closed in order to hook users and keep them there. The practice is not illegal, and these findings wouldn&#8217;t necessarily harm Apple. They are just another way for Epic to support its point that Apple uses platform lock-in to maintain its market monopoly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, iMessage is still not available on Android, and it doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;ll ever leave Apple&#8217;s walled garden. Android users, however, can take advantage of <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-enable-rcs-messaging-1047089/">RCS</a> that offers a similar experience in the Google Messages App.</p>
