First, US teenagers really, really love their iPhones, according to <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/739173/90-of-u-s-teens-say-their-next-phone-will-be-an-iphone/?utm_campaign=twitter&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitter">a new Piper Sandler survey</a> of more than 7,000 teens.</p>
<p>Apple's flagship consumer product carries immense brand loyalty among this demographic, 88% of whom own an iPhone -- with a little more than that, 90%, expecting the next phone they own to likewise be an iPhone. And among the other products and offerings from brands that teens are pretty addicted to, the survey also tags <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/04/01/best-netflix-movies-2021-april-original-releases-list/">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.snapchat.com/">Snapchat</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/">TikTok</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/?tag=b0c55rss-20">Amazon</a> as well as <a href="https://bgr.com/2020/06/08/apple-pay-coronavirus-shows-need-for-contactless-payment-options/">Apple Pay</a> as all getting high marks from teens. Meanwhile, it's not just teens who see iPhones as highly coveted status symbols and luxury items. A separate brand loyalty survey has also found peoples' loyalty to Apple and to their iPhones has hit an all-time high, while the affection for Android is undergoing a slide.</p>
