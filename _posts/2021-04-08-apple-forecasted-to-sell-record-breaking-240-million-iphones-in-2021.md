Apple is on a trajectory to sell a record-breaking 240-250 million iPhones in the 2021 fiscal year, topping a previous record of 231 million iPhones sold in the 2015 fiscal year, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.

<br/>
"While the Street is forecasting roughly 220 million iPhone units for FY21, we believe based on this current trajectory and in a bull case Cupertino still has potential to sell north of 240 million units (~250 million could be in the cards - an eye popping figure) which would easily eclipse the previous Apple record of 231 million units sold in FY15," said Ives, in a research note shared with MacRumors today.
<br/>

<br/>
Ives estimates that 350 million iPhone users worldwide are currently "in the window of an upgrade opportunity," which he believes is "translating into an unprecedented supercycle upgrade cycle" for Apple this year.

If this forecast proves to be accurate, the iPhone 12 lineup could prove to be the most popular since the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which saw strong demand following their September 2014 launch due to their larger screen sizes. Samsung already offered multiple smartphones with screen sizes at or beyond the 5-inch mark at the time.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wedbush/">Wedbush</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/07/2021-iphone-sales-forecast-wedbush/">Apple Forecasted to Sell Record-Breaking 240+ Million iPhones in 2021</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-forecasted-to-sell-record-breaking-240-million-iphones-in-2021.2290910/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
