The average <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> user spent 38 percent more in 2020 on premium apps and in-app purchases than the year before, reaching a total average spend of &#36;138 per &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in the United States, according to new research conducted by <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/revenue-per-iphone-2020">Sensor Tower</a>.

<br/>
2020 was a record year for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> spending, with more than ever being spent per &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; user. Although &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; sales grew by 42 percent in 2016, the 38 percent growth in 2020 significantly exceeds the 27 percent year-on-year increase seen between 2018 and 2019 when it rose from &#36;79 to &#36;100.

<br/>
In particular, per-device spending on mobile games saw explosive growth in 2020, jumping from &#36;53.80 in 2019 to &#36;76.80 for year-on-year growth of 43 percent. The biggest source of spending on mobile games was in the Puzzle category, which includes games like Candy Crush Saga and Gardenscapes.

<br/>
In addition to mobile games, per-iPhone spending in the Entertainment category boomed, reaching &#36;10.20, which is an increase of 26 percent over the &#36;8.10 spent in 2019.

This large increase in consumer spending per &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/08/app-store-sales-saw-unprecedented-growth-in-2020/">mirrored overall global trends</a>, which saw consumers <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/30/more-than-100-billion-spent-on-app-stores-2020/">spending more overall last year</a> as they turned to their mobile devices during the global health crisis. Average consumer spending on apps per &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in the U.S. has grown markedly each year by at least 20 percent, but it is yet to be seen if the trend will continue into 2021.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sensor-tower/">Sensor Tower</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/02/iphone-users-spent-138-on-apps/">iPhone Users Spent Average of &#36;138 on Apps Last Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-users-spent-average-of-138-on-apps-last-year.2290402/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
