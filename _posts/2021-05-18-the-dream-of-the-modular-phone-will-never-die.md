It makes sense to build an eco-friendly device that has user-replaceable parts. That way, you&rsquo;d be able to swap out old or broken modules for brand new hardware rather than ditching the entire device. You&rsquo;d be able to upgrade the chips, the battery, and the camera every few years, and maybe even the screen. You&rsquo;d also get access to more unusual modules that will deliver a specific type of functionality that isn&rsquo;t otherwise found on traditional phones.</p>
<p>But time and time again, companies failed to make modular phones popular with buyers. <a href="https://bgr.com/general/phonebloks-viability-questioned-1322063/">Phonebloks was exciting</a> for a bit. <a href="https://bgr.com/general/google-project-ara-modules-store-4006061/">Google&rsquo;s Project Ara</a> wanted modular phones but then got out of it. <a href="https://bgr.com/tech/the-lg-g6-already-looks-so-much-better-than-the-experimental-lg-g5-5555809/">LG&rsquo;s G5</a> was a quirky modular phone. Maybe Motorola was the most successful at envisioning a limited modular phone &mdash; the company&rsquo;s Moto Mods let it <a href="https://bgr.com/tech/moto-z3-5g-phone-release-date-price-specs-5642846/">upgrade a 4G mid-range phone to 5G flagship status</a> a few years ago, but the contraption looked just awful.</p>
<p>Despite that, another company thinks it can have a go at modular phones. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has filed a patent for modular phone technology recently.</p>
