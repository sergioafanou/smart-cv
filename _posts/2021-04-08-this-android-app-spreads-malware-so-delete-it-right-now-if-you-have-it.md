<p>That's what the makers of a newly discovered Android malware app called FlixOnline decided to do. Found by a team at <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Research</a>, this app has been lurking in the Google Play Store, used Netflix imagery to suck people in, and promised to allow users to view Netflix content from all around the world on their smartphones. Instead, according to <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2021/new-wormable-android-malware-spreads-by-creating-auto-replies-to-messages-in-whatsapp/">a summary of the Check Point Research findings</a> published on Wednesday, if a user ended up downloading this application and "unwittingly" granted it the appropriate permissions, "the malware is capable of automatically replying to victims' incoming WhatsApp messages with a payload received from a command-and-control (C&amp;C) server. This unique method could have enabled threat actors to distribute phishing attacks, spread false information or steal credentials and data from users&rsquo; WhatsApp accounts, and more."</p>
