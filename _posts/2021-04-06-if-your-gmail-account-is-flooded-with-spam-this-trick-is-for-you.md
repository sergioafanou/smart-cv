Well, I may be more tied to my email than probably at any point thus far in my working life because of the situation now, but that doesn't mean I have passively resigned myself to the flood of unwanted spam and cold emails that have poured into my Gmail account and continue to do so. Signing me up for and subscribing me to various email lists is particularly annoying. Needless to say, I have been marking messages as spam with wild, untamed abandon over these past many months, and my threshold of tolerance for whether or not I mark a message as spam within Gmail is continuing to shrink.</p>
