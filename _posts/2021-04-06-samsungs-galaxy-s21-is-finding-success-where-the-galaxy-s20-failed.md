There wasn't anything wrong with the new models themselves, but for whatever reason, Samsung opted to raise the price points across the lineup while simultaneously eliminating the cheaper "e" model altogether. Of course, Samsung never could have predicted that the world would shut down just days after the phone's launch, but it wasn't being set up for success. The good news is that the company learned its lesson before releasing the Galaxy S21.</p>
<p>According to market research firm Counterpoint Research, the Galaxy S21 series outsold last year's Galaxy S20 series by a two-to-one margin over the first six weeks of availability. The firm believes that the cheaper $799 entry point has been one of the keys to the turnaround, as has stronger support from US carriers in 2021.</p>
