While some companies like Facebook and Google have ballooned into multi-billion dollar corporations by leveraging what they know about you to serve up targeted advertising, other companies like Apple have made a concerted effort to keep privacy at the forefront of the user experience.</p>
<p>What's often lost in the mix during these debates is that there's a good chance your cell phone carrier, unbeknownst to you, is sharing some of your data with third parties. And while the shared data isn't necessarily identifiable to the extent that it can be directly traced back to you, it's definitely something to be aware of if you're privacy-minded.</p>
