We would have expected the Galaxy Z Flip 2 successor by now, but that&rsquo;s not the case. It&rsquo;s still unclear what sort of seasonality to expect from Samsung&rsquo;s foldable releases. Not to mention that 2021 will be a more challenging year for Samsung and other smartphone makers. The current chip shortage might convince Samsung <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/03/17/galaxy-note-21-release-date-might-be-canceled/">to cancel the Galaxy Note line temporarily</a> or even provide the company with the best excuse to discontinue it entirely.</p>
<p>Word on the street is that Samsung wants its foldable phones to replace the Note, and the company is looking to ramp up sales significantly. Before that can happen, Z Flip and Z Fold phones need to become more accessible, and Samsung is looking at ways to achieve that. The latest moves include expanding its extended trial program for foldable phones in some markets, and a significant price cut in others.</p>
