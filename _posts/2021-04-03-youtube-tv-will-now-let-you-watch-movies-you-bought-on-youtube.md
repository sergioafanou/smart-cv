<p>YouTube TV is one of the most popular internet TV services on the market, with more than 85 channels, unlimited cloud DVR, and one of the cleanest interfaces of any streaming app. Over the past few years, its price has risen significantly, jumping from $35 a month when it launched in 2017 to $65 a month in 2020.</p>
<p>The addition of new channels has been the driving force behind the ballooning price, as every network wants a cut for joining the growing channel library, but Google has continued to add new features to the service along the way as well. For example, just weeks ago, a new store tab was added to the service's TV apps, allowing users to buy new channels and bundles for their account without having to sort through a bunch of menus or log in on a browser. On Friday, yet another convenient feature was added to the popular TV service.</p>
