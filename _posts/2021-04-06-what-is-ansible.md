<p>Ansible is an open source <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-configuration-management">configuration management</a> tool that provides a minimalist server automation framework based on YAML definitions. Its simplified infrastructure requirements and accessible syntax helped make Ansible one of the most popular configuration management tools to date.</p>

<p>Unlike most tools in the same category, Ansible doesnâ€™t require specialized software to be installed on remote nodes. A control machine is set up with the Ansible software, which then communicates with the nodes via standard SSH, using Python to execute remote instructions. </p>

<p>Ansible provides a large collection of built-in modules to facilitate automating common server tasks such as installing packages, creating and managing users, manipulating files and permissions, and managing services. </p>
