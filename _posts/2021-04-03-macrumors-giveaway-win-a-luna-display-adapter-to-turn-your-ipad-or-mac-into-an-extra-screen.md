For this week's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/giveaway/">giveaway</a>, we've teamed up with <a href="https://astropad.com">Astropad</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win <a href="https://astropad.com/product/lunadisplay/">a Luna Display adapter</a> that's able to transform an extra Mac or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> into a secondary display for your primary Mac.
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<a href="https://astropad.com/product/lunadisplay/">Priced at &#36;80</a>, the Luna Display adapter is a small dongle that plugs into your Mac using a USB-C port (on newer Macs) or a Mini DisplayPort and when used in combination with the Luna Display software, your main Mac (or a PC) can be connected to an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; or another Mac over WiFi, giving you a new way to take advantage of old hardware or add an extra display without having to invest in another device.
<br/>

<br/>
When connected, the Luna Display extends the primary Mac's display to the secondary Mac or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; to allow the extra device to be used as a second screen, which is useful as people continue working and learning from home with makeshift office setups in 2021.
<br/>

<br/>
The Mac and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; have built-in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sidecar/">Sidecar</a> functionality that can turn an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; into a secondary display for a Mac without an accessory, but the Luna Display sets itself apart with the Mac-to-Mac support, which &zwnj;Sidecar&zwnj; can't do. Luna Display is also able to work with older iPads that don't support &zwnj;Sidecar&zwnj;.

<br/>
In Mac-to-Mac mode, the primary Mac needs to have OS X El Capitan or later installed, while the secondary Mac can be running OS X Mountain Lion or later, so Luna Display works with machines that are quite old. For best performance, the main Mac should be a 2012 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, MacBook Pro, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, or later, or a 2013 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> or later. As of November 2020, the Luna Display adapter <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/20/luna-display-astropad-m1-mac-support/">has native support</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> Macs, too.
<br/>

<br/>
Luna Display offers full keyboard, trackpad, and mouse support on both connected Macs in Mac-to-Mac mode, with more information on how it works available on the <a href="https://shop.astropad.com/pages/meet-mac-to-mac-mode">Luna Display website</a>.
<br/>

<br/>
For iPads, the Luna Display is compatible with almost all modern iPads, including the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 2 or later, all <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> models, all <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, and all <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models, with iOS 9.1 or later as the only requirement. Performance is faster on newer iPads, but older models work well too.

<br/>
For those who have PCs, there is <a href="https://astropad.com/luna-display-windows/">a Luna Display adapter for Windows</a>. The PC version of Luna Display extends your desktop from PC to &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, allowing your devices to work interchangeably.
