<p>According to research from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/02/iphone-users-spent-138-on-apps/">Sensor Tower</a>, iPhone users in the US spent an average of $138 on apps from the <a href="https://www.apple.com/app-store/">Apple App Store</a> in 2020, up 38% from the year prior. That includes money spent on premium apps as well as on in-app purchases, but it also doesn't even come close to reflecting the totality of what iPhone users actually spent on apps last year, since it excludes purchases from within apps like Amazon and Uber that aren't processed through the App Store.</p>
