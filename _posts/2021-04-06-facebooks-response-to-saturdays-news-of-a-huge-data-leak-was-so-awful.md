That's when the next episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sway/id1528594034"><em>Sway</em></a>, the podcast from <em>The New York Times'</em> Kara Swisher, will be available to listen to, with the new interview subject being none other than Apple CEO Tim Cook.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1378202318542417920">Swisher on Friday teased via Twitter</a> that the conversation with Cook will cover everything from the App Store drama around Parler to the iPhone maker's feud with Facebook -- the latter of which, on Saturday, inadvertently handed Cook even more ammunition to use against the social networking giant as he continues making his case that Facebook is awful. In case you haven't heard by now, there's been another huge <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-03/facebook-data-on-533-million-users-leaked-business-insider">Facebook data leak</a>, encompassing personal information from more than <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/533-million-facebook-users-phone-numbers-and-personal-data-reported-leaked-online-11617475820">533 million Facebook users</a> from 106 countries. This data was posted in a hacking forum, according to a report from <em>Insider</em>, which is to say -- if you have a Facebook account, there's a good chance your data has once again been exposed to hackers including everything from your phone number to your email address, birthday, full name, and more.</p>
