But Google remains one of the most important players in the online ads business. The company will replace the cookies with a technology that it claims will enhance user privacy. FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts) -- the new user tracking technology -- analyzes browsing history to put the user into groups with similar interests. They will then be served personalized ads based on that data.</p>
<p>Google says FLoC will protect user privacy while user data is collected for personalized ads. Some have criticized Google&rsquo;s new tool and the way the company is talking about it. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) explained in a series of blog posts why FLoC is a terrible idea, saying that the technology might lead to abuse, allowing third parties to fingerprint users. More recently, the non-profit launched a tool that tells users <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/04/11/google-chrome-floc-tracking-how-to-check-opt-out-eff/">whether they&rsquo;ve been included in Google&rsquo;s early FLoC pilot</a>. The test enrolls users automatically, without letting them choose whether or not to participate and without offering clear instructions on how to opt-out once they're in.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo, the company <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/03/18/ios-14-privacy-features-duckduckgo-vs-google-spying/">behind a popular Google Search alternative</a> that doesn&rsquo;t track users, is taking matters into its own hands, looking to block Chrome's FLoC tracking with two separate tools.</p>
