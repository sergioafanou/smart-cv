Eve today announced the availability of Thread support for the <a href="https://www.evehome.com/en-us/eve-aqua">second-generation Eve Aqua</a>, which is now available through an Eve Aqua firmware update.

<br/>
The Eve Aqua, for those unfamiliar, is a smart water controller that attaches to any outdoor faucet, adding smart functionality and irrigation controls to sprinklers and hoses.
<br/>

<br/>
Eve has been working to update all of its Bluetooth-compatible accessories with Thread technology, and several of the devices, including Eve Aqua, have a Thread-capable chipset inside that can be activated through a firmware update.
<br/>

<br/>
As a battery powered device, Eve Aqua is a Minimal Thread Device that does not relay packets, but the mesh network Thread technology in general offers extended range and connectivity improvements when paired with a Thread-capable device like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>.
<br/>

<br/>
Eve has three Thread-capable devices including the Eve Door &amp; Window and the Eve Weather, with a Thread-enabled Eve Energy smart plug coming to the U.S. at the end of April. The Eve Energy, as a continually connected device, is a Full Thread Device that enables extended range for accessories like the Eve Aqua when placed between the Eve Aqua and a &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj;.
<br/>

<br/>
The new firmware update can be downloaded through the Eve app. The Eve Aqua is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eve-Aqua-Controller-Autonomous-schedules/dp/B07D5S3QD3">available from Amazon for &#36;80</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/01/eve-aqua-thread-firmware-update/">Eve Aqua HomeKit-Connected Water Controller Gains Thread Support via Firmware Update</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eve-aqua-homekit-connected-water-controller-gains-thread-support-via-firmware-update.2290306/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
