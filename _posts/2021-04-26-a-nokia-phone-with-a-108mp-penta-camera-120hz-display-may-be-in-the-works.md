<li>Specs of the rumored Nokia X50 have leaked.</li>

<p>Nokia is reportedly planning to add another new device to its 2021 lineup of <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-5g-phones-926740/">5G capable smartphones</a>. According to <em><a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/new-nokia-mobile-5g-smartphone-nokia-x50-with-108mp-rear-camera-in-works-targeted-at-q3-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nokiapoweruser</a>,Â </em>a website dedicated to Nokia news and leaks, the company is working on a penta camera phone to succeed the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nokia-8-3-5g-1095257/">Nokia 8.3 5G</a> from last year.</p>
<p>The publication also claims to have acquired the specs of this upcoming device. As per the leak, the said Nokia phone will be powered by the unreleased Snapdragon 775 processor with model number SM7350. The chipset is <a href="https://t.me/xiaomiui/7664?single" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believed</a> to be a successor to the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-765-specs-1059745/">Snapdragon 765G</a> with a notable performance upgrade.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the follow-up to the Nokia 8.3 5G is also rumored to come with a 108MP primary sensor. Ultra-wide, depth, macro, and telephoto sensors might complete the penta camera pack. Zeiss could once again tune the optics and the phone may also get OZO Audio just like the Nokia 8.3 5G.</p>
<p>The display of the leaked Nokia phone is expected to measure 6.5-inches and feature QHD+ resolution. It&#8217;s also rumored to come with a 120Hz screen refresh rate.</p>
<p>The battery is also apparently getting a major upgrade. The Nokia 8.3 5G worked with a 4,500mAh battery, while the new phone is said to up the capacity to 6,000mAh.</p>
<p>As for the name, the phone will likely ditch Nokia&#8217;s decimal point naming convention. The company recently <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nokia-2021-phone-models-x-g-c-series-1215493/">recategorized</a> its phones into the X, G, and C series. According to the leak, this new device might fall under Nokia&#8217;s X series, with the X50 moniker.</p>
<p>The phone is expected to launch sometime in the second half of this year. We&#8217;ll let you know if we hear anything more about it going forward.</p>
