In fact, we learned this week that <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/04/02/ios-14-5-privacy-features-apple-rejects-apps-no-user-tracking-prompts/">Apple has even started rejecting apps</a> that try to track users without prompting them first. These are steps in the right direction as end users attempt to gain some semblance of control over their private data again, and in a similar fashion, Google is making a change to Android that should please privacy advocates.</p>
