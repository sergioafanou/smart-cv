<p>At Docker, we’re constantly trying to engage and connect with developer communities around the world to explore ways we can cross pollinate ideas, share, and learn from each other. Today, we’re thrilled to announce that Docker and the CNCF are joining forces to run a community-led event series called “<strong>Container Garage</strong>”, covering all things containers and focusing on a particular theme each time (eg. “runtime”, “images”, “security” etc…). The aim of the event is to engage our respective communities and foster closer collaboration.</p>



<p>To this end <a href="https://www.docker.com/community/captains">Docker Captains</a> and <a href="https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/">CNCF Ambassadors</a> are taking the lead with the planning and execution of the event, working in lock-step to curate excellent content and recruit amazing speakers for engaging talks, demos, and live panels.</p>



<p>The kick-off event will be on <strong>Thursday April 1st</strong> around the theme of container runtimes. The agenda is structured as follows:&nbsp;</p>



<p>2pm &#8211; 4pm CET : Talks &amp; Demos</p>



<p>4pm &#8211; 4:15 CET : Break</p>



<p>4:15pm &#8211; 5pm CET : Live panel discussion</p>



<p>5pm &#8211; 5:15 : Break</p>



<p>5pm &#8211; 7pm CET : Talks &amp; Demos&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, the first event will be held on April 1st on the topic of container runtimes. </p>
