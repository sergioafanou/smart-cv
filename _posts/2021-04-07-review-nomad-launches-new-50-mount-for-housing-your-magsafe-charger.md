<a href="http://www.pntrs.com/t/TUJGRUVORUJGS0lMSkxCRkZOSE1L">Nomad</a>, known for its lineup of premium accessories for Apple's devices, today announced the launch of <a href="https://www.pjtra.com/t/TUJGRUVORUJGS0lMSkxCRkZOSE1L?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fmagsafe-mount-silver">the MagSafe Mount</a>, which is designed to house the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> Charger and keep it secured on a desk.
<br/>

<br/>
The &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Mount is made from a solid block of stainless steel with a painted satin finish. There's a cutout at the top that fits a &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger, with the charger held in place with microsuction tape. A soft rubber on the bottom keeps your desk protected, but this is a mount only -- you need to supply your own &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger.

<br/>
Nomad sent me a &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Mount ahead of launch, and this thing is heavy, so I was surprised when I was able to pick up my <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Mount still attached some of the time. The Magsafe Mount weighs a mount and a half and I thought that kind of weight would keep it on the desk, but if you grab your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in a certain way, the mount can come up with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.
<br/>

<br/>
You need to make sure to pick up your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; from one side first, with the edge that's hanging off the charger, or with a bit of a twist, which many people probably do anyway. You can also use a finger underneath to do a pry up kind of gesture when you pull it up, which is more natural than it sounds. I do typically pick up my &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with a side pull, but I wasn't expecting that &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; strength.
<br/>

<br/>
In just casual use without thinking about it, I only had the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Mount lift off my desk a couple of times over the weekend, so it wasn't an ongoing issue as long as I was mindful of how I was picking it up. Since the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Mount is so heavy, though, I'm worried that I might pick it up wrong one day and send it crashing into my desk.
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
I've only had the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Mount on hand for a couple of days, so I haven't had the time to determine whether it's something that's going to bother me over time during day to day usage. I suspect most people will get used to picking an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; up off of the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Mount from the top or the bottom or with a finger at the side and it won't be an issue.
<br/>

<br/>
I do wish Nomad had used the same microsuction material used on the inside on the outside to give the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Mount a stronger attachment to a desk or a table so the slight lifting in some circumstances wouldn't have been an issue at all.
<br/>

<br/>
The design of the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Mount made it difficult to get the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger secured in place, and it's <em>really</em> in there. It's an incredibly tight fit, so this is not an accessory that you're going to want to be taking on and off a &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger. The microsuction adhesive on the inside makes it even harder to get off, and I have a bruise on the side of my thumb from trying to get it out.
<br/>

<br/>
Because the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger fits so tightly inside the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Mount, it does look great. It resembles a single piece of hardware rather than an attachment, and it's difficult to tell that there are two pieces. It's machined well and it fits precisely. The design has the USB-C cable routing through the middle and into a channel on the bottom, which contributes to the streamlined design.
<br/>

<br/>
The way the cord of the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger goes into the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Mount has me a little concerned for its impact on the life of the cord. The way the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Mount is designed produces a slight bend in the cord because of the angle that it inserts into the device, and this particular spot is sometimes a point of failure for Apple's cables. I'm not sure if I have a faulty &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Mount or if I did something unusual putting it in or pulling it out, but it's something to be aware of.

<br/>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<br/>
At &#36;50, the Magsafe Mount is an expensive addition to a &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger, which is &#36;40 on its own for a total of &#36;90, but it has a decidedly Apple-esque design that melds well with the design of the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger.
<br/>

<br/>
Those looking for a permanent desk mounting option may want to consider the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Mount, but it won't be a good fit for those looking for a solution that makes it easier to move the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger from place to place. 
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>How to Buy</h2>
<br/>
The &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Mount can be <a href="https://www.pjtra.com/t/TUJGRUVORUJGS0lMSkxCRkZOSE1L?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fmagsafe-mount-silver">purchased from the Nomad website</a> for &#36;50, but our readers can <strong>save 20 percent</strong> by entering the code <strong>MACRUMORS</strong> at checkout. This makes the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Mount &#36;39.96.
