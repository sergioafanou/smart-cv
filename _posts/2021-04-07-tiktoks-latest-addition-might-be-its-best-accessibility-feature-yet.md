The company refers to the future feature as "auto captions," and creators will see them on the editing page after they've uploaded or recorded a video in the app. If you tap the button to turn them on, the captions will automatically be generated beneath the video. At that point, you will have the option to edit them to ensure that they are accurate before you publish the video.</p>
<p>When a creator opts to add auto captions to the video, they will appear on the video unless the viewer actively decides to turn them off. If you don't want to see the captions, you can open the share panel, tap the captions button, and set the captions to off. It's just one extra step, but it opens TikTok up to a whole new group.</p>
