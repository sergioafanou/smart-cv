We've put our lives on hold for a year or more just waiting for a vaccine to be developed, tested, and rolled out. On a personal level, we've lost time with friends and family and lost out on a year's worth of social experiences, vacations, and a lot of good times. Companies and other organizations have lost money and a lot of it. NASA, which continued its various projects to the best of its ability why trying to ensure that staff remained virus-free, lost a whole lot of money as well, and a new report reveals exactly how much.</p>
<p>As <em><a href="https://spacenews.com/pandemic-to-cost-nasa-up-to-3-billion/">SpaceNews</a></em> reports, the report released this week (<a href="https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-21-016.pdf">PDF</a>) by the NASA Office of Inspector General reveals the price tag for the various setbacks the agency has already endured as well as its expected impacts in the immediate future. The cost? A whopping $3 billion. Yes, that's billion with a "b." Yikes.</p>
