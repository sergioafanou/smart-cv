<li>Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg apparently used the Signal app.</li>
<li>A security researcher used his number to confirm he had a Signal account.</li>
<li>Zuckerberg&#8217;s number was one of millions leaked in a 2019 Facebook hack.</li>
</ul>
</div><hr>
<p>It was revealed just a few days ago that phone numbers and other details belonging to 533 million Facebook users had leaked on a hacking forum. The trove of data may have been obtained via a 2019 vulnerability that has since been patched, and it turns out that Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s phone number was leaked as well.</p>
<p>Now, security researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/Daviey/status/1378645798439768064" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dave Walker</a> (h/t: <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/leaked-phone-number-of-mark-zuckerberg-reveals-he-is-on-signal-1787396-2021-04-05" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>India Today</em></a>) has used Zuckerberg&#8217;s number to discover that he used the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/signal-app-1148147/">Signal</a> messaging app. Walker also posted a screenshot showing the Facebook co-founder&#8217;s purported contact on Signal. Check it out below.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s entirely possible the Facebook co-founder simply used Signal to check out the competition and for nothing more. But there&#8217;s also the obvious implication that Zuckerberg is actively using Signal as a messaging app because he prefers its security, features, and/or design. For what it&#8217;s worth, Walker <a href="https://twitter.com/Daviey/status/1379349624088104962" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> the Signal account has been closed as of yesterday (April 5). Take that for what you will.</p>
<p>The researcher also <a href="https://twitter.com/Daviey/status/1378650409196265472" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemed to suggest</a> that Zuckerberg wasn&#8217;t on Telegram. The app allows you to restrict who can find you on the service using your phone number though, so it&#8217;s still theoretically possible the Facebook co-founder is using the platform.</p>
<p>We contacted Facebook for comment regarding Zuckerberg&#8217;s Signal account (i.e. whether it was actively used and if he was still using WhatsApp). &#8220;This isn&#8217;t something we would comment on and have nothing further to add,&#8221; a company representative told <em>Android Authority</em>.</p>
