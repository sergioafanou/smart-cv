The Cat phones feature a unique FLIR thermal sensor that lets you quickly determine the temperature of objects around you, which is something various professionals need to do on the spot. The Cat phones are rugged phones that target the workspace, and the latest addition to Bullitt&rsquo;s lineup is the $699 Cat S62 Pro phone that you can finally purchase.</p>
<p>The phone isn&rsquo;t as exciting when it comes compared to other Android devices. It doesn&rsquo;t feature the Snapdragon 888 processor that equips all 2021 flagships, nor could it. The S62 Pro was launched in Europe last year, and it&rsquo;s only hitting US stores in early April. But the device isn&rsquo;t supposed to be a standard Android flagship. It&rsquo;s supposed to be a rugged handset that can withstand some of the harshest work conditions.</p>
