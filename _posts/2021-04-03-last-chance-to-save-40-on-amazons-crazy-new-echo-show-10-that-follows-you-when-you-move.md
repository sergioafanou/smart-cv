The pandemic might've been top-of-mind for pretty much everyone out there, but life can't completely grind to a halt. Amazon's virtual personal assistant Alexa is quite possibly the most popular voice assistant out there right now, and people love Echo speakers so much. That's especially true when they go on sale &mdash; the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/all-new-Echo-Dot/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>4th-gen Echo Dot</strong></a> is down to $34.99 today, and you can even get an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Flex/dp/B07MLY3JKV?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>Echo Flex</strong></a> for just $17.49. That's right, an Alexa smart speaker for less than $18!</p>
<p>Beyond just smart speakers though, another type of Alexa gadget has really been exploding in popularity lately. We're talking about Echo Show smart displays, and Amazon's hot new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/echo-show-10/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>Echo Show 10</strong></a> got its first-ever discount this week in Amazon's big spring sale.</p>

<p>Several different Echo Show models have been released by Amazon over the years, but two have been particularly popular among our readers. First is the $90 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>Echo Show 5</strong></a>, and it happens to be on sale for just $49.99 this week. It's nice and compact so it can fit anywhere without eating up too much space, yet it packs all the main features you might want from a smart display. Then there's the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>Echo Show 8</strong></a>, which has the same features and includes a much larger display. This model retails for $130, but it's down to just $74.99 right now at Amazon.</p>
<p>In addition to those awesome smart screens, Amazon now also has the groundbreaking new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/echo-show-10/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>Echo Show 10</strong></a> in its arsenal.</p>
<p>On top of all the main features that people love so much on other Echo Show models, the new Echo Show 10 has a large 10.1-inch display. But the best new feature on the Show 10 isn't just the fact that the screen is larger... it's the fact that the screen has a motorized swivel feature that follows you around automatically! This way you can move around while you cook in the kitchen or have a video chat with your family, and the camera and display will remain pointed at you the entire time. How cool is that?!</p>
<p>Amazon's hot new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/echo-show-10/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>Echo Show 10</strong></a> has a hefty retail price of $250, but it got its first-ever price cut this week in Amazon's big sale. Hurry up and you can snag one for $209.99 for a limited time, which is a solid $40 discount.</p>
