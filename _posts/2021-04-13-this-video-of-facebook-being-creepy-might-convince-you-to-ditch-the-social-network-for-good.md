<p>First, he looked himself up on the "<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned</a>" website, which has done a good job of quickly collecting data on <a href="https://bgr.com/business/facebook-data-leak-new-phone-numbers-found-online-5918880/">Facebook users caught up in the recent breach</a> so that they can check and see if they're affected. Qureshi used the phone lookup feature that "Have I Been Pwned" offers, and he found out that -- yep, his data was included in the breach. After investigating a bit more to see just how much data that the world's largest social network has on him, though, that's when things started to look even creepier.</p>
