Those promises can't always be kept, which is why many of us turn to online speed tests when we want to know what we're actually getting for our money. The two services that most people use to determine the actual internet speeds they're getting are <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/">Ookla's Speedtest</a> and <a href="https://fast.com/">Fast.com</a>, which is powered by Netflix. But now a new entrant has arrived, as the Federal Communications Commission has launched its own mobile speed test app.</p>
<p>You can download the FCC Speed Test app today on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fcc-speed-test/id794322383">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samknows.fcc&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Android</a> for free, and once you download it, you will be asked right away if you want to set a limit for how much mobile data the app can use, if you want it to use mobile data at all. After that, you can start the test, which checks your download speeds, upload speeds, latency, jitter, and packet loss. My results looked similar to the ones I received from Ookla's Speedtest app.</p>
