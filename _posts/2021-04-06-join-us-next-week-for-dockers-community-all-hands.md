<p>Next week, on <strong>Thursday March 11th, 2021 (8am PST/5pm CET)</strong> we’ll be hosting our next quarterly <a href="https://events.docker.com/events/details/docker-docker-virtual-meetups-presents-docker-community-all-hands-2/">Docker Community All-Hands</a>. This free virtual event, open to everyone, is a unique opportunity for Docker staff and the broader Docker community to come together for company and product updates, live demos, community presentations and a live Q&amp;A.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As luck would have it, this All-Hands will coincide almost to the day with <strong>Docker’s 8th birthday</strong> (yay!). To mark the occasion, we’re going to make this event extra special by introducing :&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>a longer format (ie. 3 hours instead of 1 hour)</li><li>lots more content (ie. demos, community lightning talks and workshops)</li><li>regional content in French, Spanish and Portuguese!&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>We’re also really excited about the new video platform we’ll be using that makes it much easier for attendees to engage/connect/share with each other. </p>
