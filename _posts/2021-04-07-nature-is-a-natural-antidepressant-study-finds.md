We often work indoors, we sleep indoors, we cook most of our meals indoors and we often spend our free time relaxing indoors as well. We like to think that because we've built homes and roads and vehicles that being outdoors is an option (and something that many people enjoy) but not a necessity. As scientists are beginning to learn more and more about the effects of being outdoors on the human body and mind, it's becoming clear that we need nature in our lives if we want to be happy and healthy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-listening-sounds-nature-can-be-restorative-180977397/">A new research analysis</a> of dozens of scientific studies paints an incredibly vivid picture of how nature can dramatically change how we think and feel. The paper, which was published in <em><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/14/e2013097118">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a></em>, is a wake-up call for anyone who thinks that staying inside and shutting the curtains is the key to a stress-free life.</p>
