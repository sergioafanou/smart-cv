Not everything that happens in the forthcoming films and TV series can rival <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>. That&rsquo;s a once-in-a-decade experience for Marvel and something other studios have never been able to recreate. Hopefully, Marvel will build up to another crescendo worthy of <em>Endgame</em>, but we need to get back to the basics for that to happen. And the basics are shows like <em>WandaVision</em> and <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em>, as well as upcoming films like <em>Black Widow</em> and <em>The Eternals</em>. Feige&rsquo;s recent note that TV shows aren&rsquo;t mandatory for understanding the movies is something I constantly bring up as a reminder that the TV series are not designed to deliver major MCU developments. We won&rsquo;t see big villain reveals or major new superheroes. Still, the TV shows will advance character arcs, offer more background information, and include plenty of Easter eggs that link these properties to the movies.</p>
<p>Tempering expectation is what makes watching <em>Falcon</em> a much better experience after <em>WandaVision</em>. There are other reasons why the Falcon/Bucky team-up might be more exciting to fans than the Wanda/Vision show. But not expecting any big reveals and just enjoying the show for what it relieves some of that pressure that was felt during <em>WandaVision</em>. That said, we are now approaching Episode 5 of <em>Falcon</em>, which won&rsquo;t just be highly emotional, it&rsquo;ll also deliver a massive Marvel cameo. And now, we might know more about it &mdash; mind you, <strong>several spoilers will follow below</strong>.</p>
