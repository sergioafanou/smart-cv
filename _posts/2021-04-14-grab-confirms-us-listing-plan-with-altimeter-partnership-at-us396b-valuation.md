<p>Southeast Asian tech giant today confirmed its plans to go public in the US in partnership with Altimeter Growth, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).</p>
<p>The Singapore-headquartered Grab expects it to be the largest-ever US equity offering by a Southeast Asian company.</p>
<p>The combined entity expects its securities will be traded on NASDAQ under the symbol GRAB in the &#8220;coming months.&#8221;</p>
<p>The proposed transactions value Grab at an initial pro-forma equity value of approximately US$39.6 billion at a PIPE size of more than US$4 billion.</p>
<p>It will provide the company with approximately US$4.5 billion in cash proceeds.</p>
<p>Grab group CEO and co-founder Anthony Tan dubbed the move as &#8220;even more critical&#8221; as the region recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“It was very challenging for us too, but it taught us immensely about the resiliency of our business. Our diversified super app strategy helped our driver-partners pivot to deliveries and enabled us to deliver growth while improving profitability. As we become a publicly-traded company, we’ll work even harder to create economic empowerment for our communities, because when Southeast Asia succeeds, Grab succeeds,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>“We&#8217;ve always believed in long-term partnerships to drive impact at scale. We work closely with governments to support their national agendas and have partnered with some of the world&#8217;s best blue-chip companies. Altimeter is investing in a way that demonstrates our aligned values, with a three-year lock-up on their sponsor promote shares and unprecedented contribution of shares to our new GrabForGood endowment fund,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re joining our journey for the long-run, together with an incredible day one cap table of renowned institutional investors and sovereign wealth funds. This is testament to the global investment community’s belief in the long-term value proposition of Grab’s super app strategy and the exciting growth potential of Southeast Asia,&#8221; Tan continued.</p>
<p>Within the past months, leading Southeast Asian tech companies such as Grab and Traveloka have <a rel="follow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-11/grab-s-34-billion-spac-deal-puts-southeast-asia-tech-on-the-map">reportedly</a> been preparing for their public listing in the US through SPAC.</p>
<p>SPAC itself has been <a rel="follow" href="https://e27.co/catcha-joins-spac-bandwagon-files-for-a-us250m-ipo-in-us-20210127/">predicted</a> to become a popular, alternative way for tech companies to go public in 2021.</p>
<p>Grab said that its decision to go public was driven by &#8220;strong&#8221; financial performance in 2020, which it managed to achieve despite the pandemic.</p>
<p>Grab posted GMV of approximately US$12.5 billion in 2020, which it claimed to be surpassing pre-pandemic levels and more than doubling from 2018.</p>
