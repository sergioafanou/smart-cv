Even as recently as 2016, which saw the release of the iPhone 6s, entry-level iPhone models were still shipping with just 16GB of storage.</p>
<p>Since then, Apple has mercifully upped the amount of storage on entry-level iPhone models. Today, any new iPhone you pick up will have at least 64GB of storage. And while that's a welcome increase from the days when many people had to make do with a paltry 16GB, the reality is that 64GB in today's age simply isn't enough. When you take into account storage-hungry apps, high-res photos, and 4K video, it's remarkably easy to quickly push a 64GB device to the limit.</p>
