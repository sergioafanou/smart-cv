You&rsquo;ll find tutorials, how-tos, reviews, and step-by-step explanations that can be more useful than anything else when it comes to dealing with everyday issues. The service makes it easy to subscribe and follow creators, and also to provide feedback to the overall experience via likes/dislikes and comments. But Google is looking at altering a vital piece of the YouTube user interface, and it has already started testing the change on a select group of people.</p>
