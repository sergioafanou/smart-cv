<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10miOSKEdpStK915nQVG1SqLyRaRS2WPy">Renders</a> of Google's first smartwatch, codenamed "Rohan," have been shared by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/">Jon Prosser</a>, showing that Google plans to adopt a circular design for its flagship wearable watch.
<br/>

<br/>
Prosser shared the renders in <a href="https://youtu.be/xioX3XTRomM">an episode</a> of his YouTube show "Front Page Tech," in which he claims they were made based on marketing material he had seen from a source within Google. The renders show that the Pixel Watch will adopt a bezel-less, circular design, with no buttons, except for a crown on the right.

<br/>
The display itself, unlike the Apple Watch, features a completely circular form factor. Internally, the Pixel Watch will feature a heart rate sensor, but it so far remains unknown if it sports more advanced health features such as blood oxygen monitoring on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 6</a>.

<br/>
Like the Apple Watch, which allows users to swap and change bands, Google will offer around 20 band options for the Pixel Watch, according to Prosser. 
<br/>

<br/>
The watch will presumably run WearOS, Google's operating systems for smartwatches. As for a release, Prosser says the watch will debut "sometime in October" but warns to be cautious given Google's habit of delaying and even canceling products altogether.
<br/>

<br/>
In 2019, Google signed a &#36;40 million deal with watchmaker Fossil to take <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/18/google-buys-fossil-smartwatch-tech-40-million/">ownership of its smartwatch division</a>. As a result of the deal, Fossil smartwatches joined Google's WearOS family and also spurred widespread speculation that Google intends to make its own-branded smartwatch to compete with the Apple Watch.
<br/>

<br/>
Besides changes to make it thinner, lighter, and the screen bigger thanks to smaller bezels, the Apple Watch design has largely remained the same since its launch in 2015. A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/apple-redesigned-wrap-around-apple-watch/">recent patent</a> has revealed that Apple is researching an Apple Watch design with a display that wraps around the band</a>, where in turn, the watch band becomes an extension of the display itself. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/google-pixel-watch-leak-with-circular-design/">Google Pixel Watch Allegedly Leaks with Circular Design, Rumored to Launch in October</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-pixel-watch-allegedly-leaks-with-circular-design-rumored-to-launch-in-october.2291420/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
