The new Nokia phones got a new naming scheme, but they continue to be quite affordable if you can get your hands on one.</p>
<p>HMD introduced the new C, G, and X series of handsets, each featuring two different devices. There&rsquo;s no iPhone 12 or Galaxy S21 rival in this lineup, but HMD does pitch a feature other Android device makers might not have. The new Nokia phones should last longer than typical flagship handsets, and that doesn&rsquo;t just cover timely Android updates, which is an area where HMD has excelled in the past. Some of the new mid-range phones will also come with extended warranties, joining the three-year Android update guarantee.</p>
