A new research paper published in <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83413-8?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=commission_junction&amp;utm_campaign=3_nsn6445_deeplink_PID100052172&amp;utm_content=deeplink">Scientific Reports</a></em> reveals the discovery and study of fossilized footprints found in southern Spain that are believed to have been created by Neanderthal children. And what were these Neanderthal children doing at the time these footprints were placed? Playing on the shore, being kids.</p>
<p>The paper has to make a lot of assumptions, which is the nature of the beast when you're trying to read into behaviors using nothing but leftover footprints from 100,000 years ago. Still, the researchers seem to have a pretty good handle on what they think the young Neanderthals were up to, and it sounds a whole lot like what modern kids do at any given opportunity: hang out, goof around, and act like the kids they are.</p>
