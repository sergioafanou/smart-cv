<li>Oppo is adding virtual RAM support to Reno 5 series phones.</li>
<li>The approach temporarily turns up to 7GB of storage into temporary memory when your physical RAM runs low.</li>
<li>Oppo&#8217;s sibling brand Vivo uses this feature, but not as aggressively.</li>
</ul>
<p></div><hr></p>
<p>Oppo is the latest phone maker to use virtual memory to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/xiaomi-memory-extension-virtual-ram-1221981/">offset hardware limitations</a>. The brand is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/ae/news-releases/oppo-debuts-new-ram-expansion-technology-for-smartphones-in-mea-883913034.html">rolling out</a> a virtual RAM feature that gives <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oppo-reno-5-pro-review-1193813/">Reno 5</a>, A94 and A74 phones extra headroom when physical RAM runs short.</p>
<p>As with a similar feature for Oppo&#8217;s sibling brand Vivo, you can tap a settings option that provides up to 7GB of virtual memory using your phone&#8217;s storage. It&#8217;s not as fast as real RAM, but it should prevent your phone from choking if you&#8217;re juggling multiple apps or running any particularly intensive software. You can choose from three capacities depending on how much you need.</p>

<p>The virtual memory update should be available now on at least some devices, although access might vary depending on your region and model.</p>
<p>This won&#8217;t give you the performance of a <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/asus-rog-phone-5-1193926/">ROG Phone 5</a> or another device with giant heaps of real memory. Storage is typically much slower than RAM, and the virtual memory might struggle if you&#8217;re running certain games or other apps that need quick access. This should, however, reduce the pressure to buy a new phone just for the extra memory —and it might let you get away with a lower-cost phone if you otherwise aren&#8217;t very demanding.</p>
