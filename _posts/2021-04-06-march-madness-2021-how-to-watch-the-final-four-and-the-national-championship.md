Dozens of games have been played in Indianapolis over the last two weeks, and this Saturday, two matchups will decide which teams play in the National Championship game.</p>
<p>For those of you that stopped keeping up after your team lost or your bracket was fully busted, the final four teams in the NCAA Tournament this year are Gonzaga, Baylor, Houston, and UCLA. Gonzaga was the odds-on favorite before the tournament even started, but they'll have their hands full with a UCLA team that has knocked off Michigan State, BYU, Alabama, and Michigan already. Meanwhile, Baylor and Houston have had a few scares, but have been playing some of their best basketball over the last two weeks as high seeds in their regions.</p>
<p>It all begins on Saturday, April 3rd, as Houston takes on Baylor starting at 5:14 p.m. ET on CBS.</p>
