Microsoft today shared an ad that pits the Surface Pro 7 against Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, in a continuation of a Surface Pro 7 vs. MacBook ad campaign that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/23/microsoft-surface-pro-7-vs-macbook-pro-ad/">kicked off in January</a>.
<br/>

<br/>
The ad highlights the Surface Pro 7's kickstand, pointing out that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> does not have a built-in kickstand option, and it calls the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s keyboard "a lot heavier" than the Surface option.
<br/>

<br/>
Microsoft also goes for the dongle angle, pointing out that the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; only has a single USB-C port while the Surface Pro 7 has several available ports. "You wanna be this guy?" says the actor in the ad, while holding up an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; with a dongle attached.
<br/>

<br/>
"&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s just a tablet," adds the actor. "Surface is a whole computer and a tablet." The ad ends by pointing out the price with the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-keyboard/">Smart Keyboard</a>, which comes to &#36;1,348 for the 12.9-inch model (&#36;999 + &#36;349 for the keyboard). Microsoft's Surface Pro 7 is priced starting at &#36;750, and Microsoft says the version used in the ad is &#36;880, which includes the cost of the keyboard.  
<br/>

<br/>
Microsoft's previous Surface Pro 7 ad compared the tablet to the MacBook Pro, pointing out its touchscreen vs. the Touch Bar and calling the Surface Pro a "much better gaming device" than the MacBook Pro.
<br/>

<br/>
Microsoft often likes to position its Surface line as a tablet/computer experience that Apple is unable to compete with because it has no convertible devices. Intel too has been claiming that touchscreen-based convertible computers are better than Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> Macs in its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/intel-anti-dongle-m1-mac-ad/">ongoing anti-Mac ad campaign</a>.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple executives have long said that they have no plans to combine the Mac and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; lineups, and Apple engineering chief Craig Federighi <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/12/apple-execs-m1-interview/">said in November</a> that Apple does not have plans for a touchscreen Mac.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/">Microsoft</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/05/microsoft-surface-pro-7-vs-ipad-pro-ad/">Microsoft Pits Surface Pro 7 Against iPad Pro, Says Surface is &#039;Still the Better Choice&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-pits-surface-pro-7-against-ipad-pro-says-surface-is-still-the-better-choice.2290682/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
