Apple has a trio of manufacturers lined up with new products that are able to integrate with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a> app, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/07/chipolo-one-spot-item-tracker-find-my/">Chipolo's item trackers</a>, <a href="https://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-AUC002/">Belkin's SOUNDFORM earbuds</a>, and <a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/news/en-US/198035-vanmoof-s3-and-x3-now-work-with-apple-s-find-my-app">e-bikes from VanMoof</a>.

<br/>
Starting today, new S3 and E3 electric bikes ordered from VanMoof will be compatible with the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app, and will be able to be tracked using &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; right alongside Apple devices.
<br/>

<br/>
Once connected to the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app, a VanMoof S3 or X3 bike will be listed in the "Items" tab on the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app, and will be trackable should the bike go missing. Items that integrate with &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; can take advantage of the networking feature that Apple built into the app, so any nearby <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac will be able to detect a lost item and securely relay its location to the owner.

<br/>
New VanMoof models with &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; integration <a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/en-US/electric-bikes">can be ordered today</a>, though it takes months for new bikes to be shipped out. VanMoof's bikes are priced starting at &#36;1,998.
<br/>

<br/>
Belkin is also working on a Find My-enabled accessory, the SOUNDFORM Freedom True Wireless Earbuds. Belkin actually announced these earbuds <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/11/belkin-magsafe-charger-find-my-earbuds/">in January at CES</a>, and in addition to &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; integration, they'll offer up to eight hours of play time, environmental noise cancellation, and Qi-based wireless charging.

<br/>
Belkin's SOUNDFORM Freedom True Wireless Earbuds are only <a href="https://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-AUC002/">available for preorder</a> and are expected to be released in June, which is also the launch timeline for the Chipolo ONE Spot item trackers with &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; integration that we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/07/chipolo-one-spot-item-tracker-find-my/">covered in another article</a>.

Given the long wait times for these new devices, it could be a few months before we're able to get a hands-on look at how &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; integration works with third-party accessories. Apple says that additional manufacturers will be releasing devices with &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; integration in the future.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/07/find-my-third-party-accessories/">VanMoof E-Bikes Gain Find My Integration as Belkin Prepares to Launch Find My SOUNDFORM Earbuds</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/vanmoof-e-bikes-gain-find-my-integration-as-belkin-prepares-to-launch-find-my-soundform-earbuds.2290955/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
