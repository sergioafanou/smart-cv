<p>We are sharing a recap of last week&#8217;s <a href="https://events.docker.com/events/details/docker-docker-virtual-meetups-presents-docker-community-all-hands-2/">second quarterly Community All-Hands</a> and the feedback we got from the community.</p>



<p>The Community All-Hands deepen our engagement with the Docker community and bring users, contributors and staff together on a quarterly basis. It is an opportunity for the community to get updates on what we’re working on and align on priorities for the year. It also provides a live forum for the community to engage and ask questions directly to Docker’s executive and community leadership. </p>



<p>In December, <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/connecting-with-the-docker-community-recap-of-our-first-community-all-hands/">we wrote that </a>we wanted to build on the feedback we got after our first Community All-Hands and that we are committed to providing more content, a longer format and make it more interactive for attendees. To this end, we chose to extend the event by 2 hours and include parallel tracks with more speakers and a mix of live keynotes, workshops, lightning talks and regional content. We also picked the <a href="http://tulul.la">Tulu.la</a> video platform to host the event, leveraging their awesome innovative features (eg. integrated chat, multi-casting, WebRTC).</p>



<p>These improvements paid off in an impressive way: we had close to 3,000 unique attendees (including Youtube-live stream viewers), almost tripling the number of attendees who tuned in last time. The turnout was exceptional and the engagement from the community throughout the event was phenomenal.</p>



<p>The feedback we got for this second edition was also very positive, with survey results showing that:</p>



<ul><li>92% of (187 respondents) gave 4 stars or more to the event.<img loading="lazy" width="624" height="316" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/TKa7mMUzqlTdEe56_Zj-MRey4_ffMnVqQ7-vimBRgnKuQDeM46BOLIEwsVjybI2SLKXcZcv1vM1xmD15Ca6oXw6Bfpbm3YtFvKzsA4b-rsVaMvvRRJy81-NKDQXZi6qwlWd08fLO"><br><br></li><li>93% were likely to recommend the event to a friend.<img loading="lazy" width="624" height="383" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/J9LFafvKQ9n6wrf8yagt9wCRv7jcJrvhaBN1j1lQlEPQCf_eUCMKj8JRTBKrQH5H2B2YwwXJ0BvJ61XfQn2rh8OC5-zZlhRx53G4r7FCnuHSulwvq4l0Tis7MgEkul0fq-_ZHyVY"><br></li></ul>



<ul><li>75% thought the length of the event was just right.<img loading="lazy" width="624" height="361" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/V39pAjZB_aL3uPu4HYKRN7TLO5q_gNUBIsD3btjtCWGWUYAyRVnsRwX3ypc1VFzSGTFlhLqrzFtrxKqJg3gYoxg9GLWQMPqMXGOECpVyJ_akS64-D9BuT856rZ-U6tS7f087iSSB"><br><br></li><li>65% saying they’d like for us to use the same video platform next time.<img loading="lazy" width="624" height="299" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LLWE5YPAsUbieYe7-x6FWcqp4HIRDuG61E_mkhy9dtLZ_6IQ9MAyig3itu6CLA6HdC6siM4LSGkXy98x1ke8dxVzggf8N73Reuop-i1MlwUH8fuGuz1sEfyBgIvLEe4gOki3m3Vx"></li></ul>



<p>Perhaps the two most recurrent suggestions for improvement we’ve received is that next time, in the run-up to the event, we should communicate the final schedule far more in advance and we should also provide a short 1-minute video tutorial to attendees on how to navigate the video platform. Clearly, it took a bit of time for some people to get used to the live multi-streaming of the event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ll close by saying a huge THANK YOU to all the speakers, to the Tulula team and to all those who attended the event. Community events are a key pillar of our community-building strategy and this All-Hands was an epic experience. We look forward to continuing to improve this Community-All Hands experiment and we will always push for more participation and engagement from the community.</p>



<p>&nbsp;If you missed the event, worry not, we made sure to record <em>everything</em>:&nbsp;</p>
