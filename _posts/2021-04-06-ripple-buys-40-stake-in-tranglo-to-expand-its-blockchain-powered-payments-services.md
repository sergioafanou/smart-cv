<p>Ripple, a leading provider of enterprise blockchain solutions for global payments, announced today it has agreed to acquire 40 per cent of Tranglo, a Malaysian cross-border payments firm.</p>
<p>As per a press note, the partnership will allow Ripple to meet &#8220;growing customer demand&#8221; in the region and expand the reach of on-demand liquidity (ODL), which uses the digital asset XRP to send money instantly and reduce working capital needs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tranglo will play a critical role in supporting Ripple&#8217;s existing corridors, such as the Philippines, and introducing new ODL corridors within its current network.</p>
<p>Completion of this transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions and is expected to occur in 2021.</p>
<p>As Ripple broadens its footprint in the region, RippleNet customers using ODL will also be able to leverage the blockchain firm&#8217;s Line of Credit to free up working capital and scale cross-border payments into more markets than ever before.</p>

<p>Tranglo will continue to provide and expand its current payment services to make cross-border transactions faster, cheaper and more secure for its customers.</p>
<p>Southeast Asia’s payments landscape is highly fragmented. Each country comes with its own unique process and payments infrastructure &#8212; the lack of a standard integration for regional cross-border payments currently requires expensive workarounds.</p>
<p>This partnership will see both companies combine their in-depth local expertise to address the challenges associated with cross-border payments.</p>
<p>Last week, <a rel="follow" href="https://www.finews.asia/finance/34062-ripple-appoints-southeast-asia-md-brooks-entwistle">Ripple appointed Brooks Entwistle</a> as Managing Director for Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>According to Asheesh Birla, General Manager of RippleNet, Tranglo&#8217;s payments infrastructure, coupled with its unparalleled customer service, makes it an ideal partner to support its expansion of ODL starting with the Southeast Asia region.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the deal, Amir Sarhangi, VP of Product and Delivery at Ripple, and Entwistle will join Tranglo&#8217;s board of directors.</p>
<p>TNG Fintech Group, which <a rel="follow" href="https://www.tngwallet.hk/en/press/15102018-16-tng-acquires-global-cross-border-payment-gateway-company-tranglo-from-malaysian-national-private-equity-fund-ekuinas-at-us28-million">acquired Tranglo in 2018 in a US$28-million deal</a>, will remain the majority shareholder.</p>
<p>Ripple allows users to send money globally using blockchain. By joining Ripple’s global network (RippleNet), financial institutions can process their customers&#8217; payments anywhere in the world instantly, reliably and cost-effectively. Banks and payment providers can use the digital asset XRP to further reduce their costs and access new markets.</p>
<p>With offices in San Francisco, Washington D.C., New York, London, Mumbai, Singapore, São Paulo, Reykjavik and Dubai, Ripple has more than 300 customers around the world.</p>
<p>Founded in 2008, Tranglo is a cross-border payment hub providing business payment, foreign remittance and mobile payment solutions.</p>
<p>Its global network spans more than 100 countries, 2,500 mobile operators, 1,300 banks/wallets and 130,000 cash pickup points.</p>
<p>It has offices in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Jakarta, Dubai and London.</p>
<p>In January 202, Tranglo <a rel="follow" href="https://e27.co/tranglo-enters-into-cross-border-remittance-partnership-with-alipay-to-serve-migrant-workers-20200108/">announced a collaboration</a> to facilitate cross-border remittances to users of Alipay, who will be able to receive quick and secure money transfers within the app.</p>
