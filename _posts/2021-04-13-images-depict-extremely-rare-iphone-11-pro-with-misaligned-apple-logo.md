Apple has in place stringent quality control standards on the assembly line floor to prevent mistakes in production, but that doesn't mean they don't happen.

Images shared on Twitter reveal a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/">iPhone 11</a> Pro with a misaligned Apple logo on the back of the device, a misprint that is said to be as rare as 1 in a million.
<br/>

<br/>
The images, <a href="https://twitter.com/ArchiveInternal/status/1380511781131550722?s=20">posted by Internal Archive</a>, clearly show the Apple logo is canted up from the base and slightly off-center, making it closer to the right than it should be. 
<br/>

<br/>
The Internal Archive, which often shares images of Apple prototypes, claims the misprint could "possibly be even rarer" than 1 in a million, which apparently made the device a sought-after item – it recently sold for &#36;2,700, according to the Twitter account. The phone was purchased in an Apple Store and the customer kept and resold it.
