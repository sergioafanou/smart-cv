<p>If anime, fantasy, and gaming content is your bag, it can be hard to find the right streaming service, especially if you want a one-stop shop for all your streaming needs. VRV is up to the challenge though.</p>
<p>The geeky streaming service has a pretty niche appeal. It&#8217;s likely to either be exactly what you&#8217;re looking for, or have nothing for you.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on the fence, though, have a look at our breakdown. We&#8217;ll fill you in on everything you need to know about VRV and whether it&#8217;s the streaming site you&#8217;ve been looking for.</p>

<h2>What is VRV?</h2>
<p>VRV (pronounced &#8220;verve&#8221;) is a standalone streaming service that focuses on anime, animation, gaming, comedy, fantasy, and technology. The service launched in 2016 and has been expanding ever since.</p>
<p>The service bundles similar content into dedicated &#8220;channels&#8221; to let you organize your viewing according to subgenres and interests.</p>

<p>Whether VRV is worth it really depends on your viewing tastes. If all you want in a streaming service is romcoms, horror movies, or reality TV, for example, keep walking. This service just won&#8217;t give you what you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>If you want to know whether there&#8217;s enough content to justify a paid membership, then the answer is yes. You&#8217;re getting a solid amount of stuff to watch without breaking the bank, and the more of it you want to watch, the more that value goes up.</p>
<div id="howdoesitwork" class="content-section-divider" data-label="How does it work?"></span></div>
<h2>How does VRV work?</h2>
<p>VRV works a lot like other streaming services in that you sign up and have unlimited access to a &#8220;Premium&#8221; library. Stream whatever you want, whenever you want. But it has one huge advantage in that the library (or libraries) you sign up for can be customized, to some degree.</p>
<p>When you sign up for <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-netflix-2-1136891/">Netflix</a>, it doesn&#8217;t matter if all you plan to watch is, say, British crime shows, or nature documentaries, or <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-netflix-original-series-949992/">Netflix original movies</a>. Most streamers work that way. It&#8217;s kind of like getting a cable package. You pay for whatever&#8217;s included. If the package that has your favorite movie channel also comes with <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-espn-plus-957392/">ESPN</a>, it doesn&#8217;t matter if you like sports or not. You&#8217;re getting sports.</p>
<p>VRV offers you the chance to strip the service down to just what you want from it — basically, you can get your movie channel without the sports. It&#8217;s still like a cable package in that &#8220;channels&#8221; don&#8217;t just have one thing, but they&#8217;re tailored to meet your needs with more precision.</p>
<p>So for example, you can subscribe to Crunchyroll and Rooster Teeth as standalone services, or you can get them as part of your Premium bundle if you&#8217;re a fan of both. There are advantages to getting the bundle though, like early access, an ad-free experience, and exclusive channels.</p>

<p>VRV comes in at the fairly average subscription price of $10 per month, but that&#8217;s for access to the whole library. If you want to zero in on the channels you like, you&#8217;re trimming down your subscription rather than paying for add-ons (which is how Amazon Prime offers customizability).</p>
<div class="aa_custom_button_wrapp center"><a class="aa_button cbs_button add-active fasc-alignment-center center" style="background-color: #ff8800;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://vrv.co/">Sign up for VRV</a></div>
<h3>Can I get VRV for free?</h3>
<p>VRV Premium is a paid subscription service, but you have a few options if you want it for free.</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s the free trial, which is by definition a limited-time opportunity. When you sign up, you can click on the 30-day free trial and enjoy the service for free for about a month. Just make sure to cancel your subscription before the trial period ends to avoid being charged.</p>
<p>VRV also has over 20,000 hours of free content, which varies and is updated regularly. Some channels will have exclusive series for members who have a Premium account, so heads up that you won&#8217;t have access to everything even on &#8220;free&#8221; channels.</p>
<p>The downside to watching your favourite content for free using this method is that you&#8217;ll have to sit through ads, and you won&#8217;t get all content as soon as you would with a Premium account.</p>
<div id="howtosignup" class="content-section-divider" data-label="How to sign up"></span></div>
<h2>How do I sign up for VRV?</h2>
<p>If this kind of service is appealing to you, head over to the <a href="https://vrv.co/">VRV website</a> to sign up and start watching.</p>
<p>You can check out the free content first, or grab a free trial before committing to a paid membership.</p>

<p>Current VRV Premium channels are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cartoon Hangover</li>
<li>Crunchyroll</li>
<li>HIDIVE</li>
<li>MONDO</li>
<li>Rooster Teeth</li>
<li>VRV Select</li>
</ul>
<p>You may wonder why you&#8217;d want to sign up for VRV for something like <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-crunchyroll-1095665/">Crunchyroll</a>, which is available as a standalone streamer. It&#8217;s a fair question, especially if you already have a free Crunchyroll account. With VRV, you can keep everything in one place, and as a VRV Premium subscriber, your Crunchyroll membership will be upgraded to Premium, giving you access to more content, simulcast for quicker access, no ads, discounts on the Crunchyroll store, and more.</p>
<p>But VRV does more than just bring together your existing services with extra perks. As a Premium member, you also get exclusive channels like Cartoon Hangover, MONDO, and VRV Select.</p>
<div id="bestshowsandmovies" class="content-section-divider" data-label="Best shows and movies"></span></div>
<h2>What can I watch on VRV?</h2>
<p>So, a list of channels is all well and good, but what&#8217;s on those channels? And how do you choose the right ones for you?</p>
<p>Some channels cast a wide net. Exclusive channel VRV Select includes a broad, curated selection of popular films and series. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>HarmonQuest</li>
<li>Cyanide and Happiness</li>
<li>My Brother, My Brother and Me</li>
<li>Hidden America!</li>
</ul>
<p>Crunchyroll, which is also available as a <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-crunchyroll-1095665/">standalone service</a>, has a huge selection of anime. With a Premium membership, some of those titles are even simulcast so that you can watch as they air in Japan. Popular titles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</li>
<li>Dr. Stone</li>
<li>Attack on Titan</li>
<li>One-Punch Man</li>
<li>Naruto</li>

<li>Bravest Warriors</li>

</ul>
<p>Have a look around on VRV to find your favorite channels.</p>
<div id="devicesupport" class="content-section-divider" data-label="Device support"></span></div>
<h2>What devices are supported by VRV?</h2>
<p>VRV is available on most of the major devices you&#8217;d expect. You can watch on your web browser, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-chromecast-with-google-tv-1161516/">Chromecast</a>, iOS phones/iPads, Android devices OS v5.0 and above as well as Android TV, Fire TV, Apple TV, and newer <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/roku-1154973/">Roku devices</a>.</p>
<h3>Can I download videos from VRV?</h3>
<p>While VRV is an online streamer, there are probably times you&#8217;ll want to watch your favorite content when you don&#8217;t have internet access. Say you&#8217;re taking a train with spotty Wi-Fi over the holidays to see your folks. That&#8217;s a perfect time to queue up some anime. No worries. VRV is set up for that, as long as you have a Premium account.</p>
<p>You can download content to your device of choice through the VRV app on iOS and Android. Tap the arrow icon next to the episode you want, and it&#8217;ll be synced to your device and available in your &#8220;offline viewing&#8221; list.</p>
<p>Now, unlike some other streamers, VRV does limit the functionality of your offline downloads. You&#8217;ll have offline access for a limited, set amount of time (usually seven days), and you&#8217;ll have 48 hours to watch any given title from the time you press play. Because of some licensing agreements, there are some titles that can&#8217;t be downloaded, but most can, and VRV is working to expand offline availability everywhere else.</p>

<p>VRV&#8217;s main strength is its niche appeal. <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/amazon-prime-video-streaming-service-1140081/">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/amazon-prime-video-streaming-service-1140081/">Amazon Prime Video</a>, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-hbo-max-1152711/">HBO Max</a>, and similar sites cast a wide net, hoping to appeal to a wide audience. Those can range in price up to almost $20 per month, and Amazon offers additional channels on top of that.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Read also:</strong> <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-anime-on-amazon-prime-video-1081951/">The best anime on Amazon Prime Video</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, VRV keeps prices relatively low while bundling a pretty carefully curated line-up of content for a more dedicated audience of gaming and anime fans.</p>
<p>Streaming is a crowded field, and the &#8220;streaming wars&#8221; have only heated up since the early days of Netflix. The space includes the above services as well as <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/disney-plus-streaming-service-923534/">Disney Plus</a>, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-tv-plus-969001/">Apple TV Plus</a>, Mubi, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-peacock-1030392/">Peacock</a>, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-shudder-1030147/">Shudder</a>, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-britbox-1092132/">Britbox</a>, the Criterion Channel, and seemingly <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/netflix-alternatives-1012485/">more new options every day</a>. So, VRV is holding its own less as a big tent and more as a niche, targeted service for a very specific clientele. Just as Shudder knows its horror crowd, VRV knows who it&#8217;s speaking to.</p>
<p>Scrolling through the offering, you either get what it&#8217;s about right away, or else it&#8217;s likely just not for you.</p>
