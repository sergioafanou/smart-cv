That might finally change in the near future, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/apple-launches-an-app-for-testing-devices-that-work-with-find-my-signaling-third-party-device-program-will-soon-go-live/">as <em>TechCrunch</em> reports</a> that Apple launched a new app called Find My Certification Asst. on Sunday, April 4th. You might be wondering how exactly this app relates to a new Apple product, but we'll get to that in a little while.</p>
<p>As the App Store page for the app explains, Find My Certification Assistant is for MFi licensees who want to "test discovery, connection, and other key requirements for accessories you develop that incorporate Find My network technology." Currently, the Find My app is used to locate lost iPhone, iPad, Mac, and AirPods models, but in the near future, Apple is going to add support for third-party devices developed by other companies.</p>
