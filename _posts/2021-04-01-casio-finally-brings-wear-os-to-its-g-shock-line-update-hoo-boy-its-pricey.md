<p><strong>Update, April 1, 2021 (02:00 PM ET): </strong>When we published this post, Casio hadn&#8217;t divulged pricing information for the new Wear OS G-Shock watch. We now know that the upcoming wearable will cost $699 here in the United States and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=74660X1524607&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=csbrown&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fg-shock.co.uk%2Fgsw-h1000-1er">£599</a> in the United Kingdom. Ouch.</p>
<p>We still do not have a solid release date, though.</p>

<p><strong>Original article, April 1, 2021 (10:49 AM): </strong>When it comes to tough-as-nails watches, few brands live up to the reputation of Casio&#8217;s G-Shock line. Although Casio has brought plenty of smarts to these watches over the years, they haven&#8217;t ever quite become traditional smartwatches.</p>
<p>That changes now. Today, Casio announced that it will launch a G-Shock watch with <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/wear-os-1183456/">Google&#8217;s Wear OS</a> as the platform. This will marry the ruggedness of the G-Shock line — including 20-bar (200m) water-resistance — with the versatility of the Wear OS platform.</p>

<p>The first Casio Wear OS G-Shock watch will officially be known as the GSW-H1000. There will be three models of the watch: the GSW-H1000-1 with blue accents (seen in the image above), the GSW-H1000-1A with gray accents, and the GSW-H1000-1A4 with red accents.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Casio did not announce a release date or pricing for this new watch line.</p>
<p>Although Wear OS offers a robust app library and good integration with Android phones, it requires very high-end hardware to work well and is pretty bad with battery life. As of now, it&#8217;s unclear if and how the Casio Wear OS G-Shock watch will address those deficiencies.</p>
