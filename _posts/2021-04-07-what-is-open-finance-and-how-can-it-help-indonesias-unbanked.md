<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One hundred and thirty million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is the number of adults within Indonesia who do not use traditional bank accounts to access financial services such as loans and credit cards. Instead, they utilise fintech services such as digital wallets and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending to fulfil their financial needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With over 360 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">registered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fintech companies within Indonesia, the growth of the industry is well documented. However, the financial data of their customers is often stored in silos and not exchanged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This creates a significant problem for both companies and consumers, as the former lack the necessary information to confidently offer loans and other financial products for the latter. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As consumers are unable to access the right financial products to help improve their financial wellbeing, <a rel="follow" href="https://e27.co/dont-break-the-bank-enabling-financial-inclusion-and-equity-through-tech-20201209/">a financial divide is created</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With &#8216;<a rel="follow" href="https://medium.com/tapico/what-is-open-finance-4cb4efae074a">Open Finance</a>&#8216;, such an issue could be easily solved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Finance is the unbundling of financial data and services to allow companies and consumers to securely leverage their data and obtain a clearer picture of an individual’s financial footprint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This creates a mutually beneficial relationship for both consumers and fintech companies, as the consequent unlocking of access to more suitable financial products help accelerate financial inclusion and narrow the divide.</span></p>

<h1><strong>Welcomed by consumers</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an open exchange of information, fintech companies can better gauge a consumer’s current financial situation by analysing his/her credit and income data. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This allows companies to offer hyper-personalised solutions that are tailored to the financial needs of consumers. Crucially, this grants the unbanked population access to financial products that they would previously have had no access to without Open Finance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, the concept of Open Finance promotes fairer pricing. With increased transparency between financial products such as insurance premiums and credit loans, it is easier for consumers to compare prices and features of similar products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will help them get more value from their providers and combat scenarios where they are unaware that they are overpaying for a poor product. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increased competition would lead to better products at more competitive prices, with the ultimate winner being consumers themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Finance also drives increased financial inclusion by encouraging better financial management. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers can have full access to their digital financial footprint, gaining a better understanding of their overall financial position &#8212; from spending habits to monthly payments for insurance premiums. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By being constantly aware of their digital finances, consumers can improve their financial wellbeing, accelerating financial inclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A case in point of how Open Finance can benefit everyday individuals can be found within the gig economy. With gig workers accounting for </span><a rel="follow" href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2020/09/04/gig-economy-supports-indonesias-economic-resilience.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">56 per cent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Indonesia’s labour force, they represent a sizeable portion of the local workforce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, <em>CB Insights</em> had</span><a rel="follow" href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/fintech-companies-gig-economy/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that gig workers without a regular income stream often face difficulties obtaining loan approvals or other banking services through traditional financial institutions such as banks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This stems from the fact that gig platforms store the financial data of their workers on their platform by embedding them within native digital wallets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, this data was not exchanged with external financial institutions, hindering them in assessing the suitability of gig workers for loans and other financial products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with Open Finance, financial data from gig platforms are securely aggregated from different financial platforms to assist companies in better identifying gig workers and providing them with</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">suitable financial products.</span></p>
<h2>Benefits for fintech platforms</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With open finance platforms like <a rel="follow" href="https://e27.co/finantier-raises-funding-in-an-east-ventures-led-round-to-introduce-open-finance-to-sea-20201123/">Finantier facilitating the open exchange of financial data</a>, companies can offer an individualised pre-filled signup process for each prospective customer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This reduces the friction needed to onboard and provides an improved customer experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, it helps fintech companies minimise operational costs and risks. By accessing financial data such as the income level and credit history of users, companies can better understand the financial position of their clients and generate better credit scores.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This results in higher approvals and lower defaults, helping companies reduce costs while increasing revenue. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Finance also enables e-KYC (electronic know your customer). With e-KYC, fintech companies can digitally identify their customers to streamline verification processes and reduce fraud. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies can also leverage increased access to<a rel="follow" href="https://e27.co/single-sign-ensures-great-user-experience-loyalty-improved-data-gathering-capabilities-20170605/"> user data to develop data-driven processes</a> and offer tailored solutions for consumers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, insurtech companies can make use of Open Finance to gain visibility of the historical financial data of customers, allowing them to generate a more accurate risk profile and offer appropriate risk-adjusted premiums. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, it enables the removal of intermediaries as various services, including payments and claims, are seamlessly embedded into the platform, resulting in better engagement and lesser drop-offs.</span></p>
<h2>Financial equaliser</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Open Finance democratises access to financial services, benefitting both consumers and fintech companies. It levels the playing field for consumers and helps drive financial inclusion within the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to equal financial services should be a right, not a privilege. Open Finance is making this statement a reality.</span></p>
