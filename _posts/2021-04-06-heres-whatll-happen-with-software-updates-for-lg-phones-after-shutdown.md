<li>LG will continue providing software updates to certain phones in certain regions even after its mobile division shuts down.</li>
<li>Android 12 might also be on the cards for some LG phones.</li>
<li>However, the company&#8217;s plans are not set in stone.</li>
</ul>

<p>LG is <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/lg-smartphone-shutdown-1214995/">officially shutting down</a> its smartphone business, and while that means we won&#8217;t see any new LG phones in the future, the company hasn&#8217;t completely ditched its existing devices. Not just yet.</p>
<p>The firm noted in its <a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/04/lg-to-close-mobile-phone-business-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> that it&#8217;ll continue providing software updates to its phones and that these updates will vary by region.</p>
<p>Separately, the company also provided some more clarity on its <a href="https://www.lge.co.kr/lgekor/contents/mobile/swUpgradeDetail.do?swSeq=1441" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Korean website</a> (h/t <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/lg-android-12-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>XDA Developers</em></a>) regarding software support plans for its phones.</p>
<p>According to LG (machine translated), the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-11-update-tracker-1155652/">Android 11</a> update is currently in progress for select models, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/lg-android-11-update-1207506/">as previously announced</a>. Some LG phones will also be upgraded to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-12-features-1195735/">Android 12</a>. However, the OS update plans will depend on Google&#8217;s distribution schedule, product performance, and product stabilization.</p>
<p>The company also plans to continue providing security updates to its phones but says that it can change its policy at any time in the future.</p>
<p>Essentially, LG&#8217;s software support plans are up in the air. You might get the Android 12 update on your LG Velvet or Wing, but don&#8217;t be too sure of it right now.</p>
<p>Given that the mobile division is going through a big transition, we won&#8217;t be surprised if some of those promised updates are also delayed. Also, LG doesn&#8217;t have a great track record when it comes to providing timely software updates. Its devices are usually upgraded months after their peers, and we expect these schedules to become even more uncertain going forward.</p>
<p>When questioned on the matter, LG spokesperson Ken Hong told <em>Android Authority</em>, &#8220;Yes, future Android updates will be coming for some phones in certain markets, although I do not know if the US is included in that list.&#8221;</p>
<p>The official pointed us to the US team for more clarification on software updates for LG phones in the region. We&#8217;ll update this article if and when we get a response from the company.</p>
