The former initially confirmed talks with the iPhone maker before denying that any negotiations took place for Apple Car manufacturing.</p>
<p>The deal would have seen Kia mass-produce the Apple Car at one of its US factories, dedicating an entire production line to Apple. Apple would have provided the hardware design and software, rather than repurposing any of Hyundai or Kia&rsquo;s models. But the car might have been built on Hyundai&rsquo;s brand new electric platform. Reports later said that Apple canned the deal, annoyed that Hyundai had revealed something it shouldn't have.</p>
<p>A new report out of Korea suggests that another company is now in line to take over. This time, it&rsquo;s not Hyundai-Kia rumored to be close to an Apple Car contract, but LG, via its partnership with Magna.</p>
