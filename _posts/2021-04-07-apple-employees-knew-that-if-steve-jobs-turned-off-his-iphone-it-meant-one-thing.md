<p>But Jobs' former executive assistant Naz Beheshti paints a different picture of her old boss in her new book <a class="norewrite" title="Buy from Amazon" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1608687236/?tag=b0c55rss-20" rel="sponsored" data-amzn-asin="1608687236"><em>Pause. Breathe. Choose: Become the CEO of Your Well-Being</em></a>. Focused largely on her wellness coaching practice, she also sprinkles the book with nuggets about the mercurial Apple chief executive who prodded Apple to generate a string of hit products like the Mac, iPod, <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/04/06/iphone-hidden-features-back-tap-screenshot-setup/">iPhone</a>, and iPad, who was known for melting down when employees didn't live up to his standards -- and who seems to also have put a premium on quiet time, where he could take a mental break, uninterrupted by the demands of being a CEO. Such that, on the rare occasions when he turned off his iPhone, Apple employees seem to have had a good idea of where that meant Jobs was hiding away: In the office of Jony Ive, Apple's former head of design, where he'd be dreaming about the future and playing with mockups and prototypes that Jobs often referred to as his "toys."</p>
