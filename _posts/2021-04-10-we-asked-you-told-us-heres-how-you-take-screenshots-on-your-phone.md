<p>We&#8217;d probably be lost without some smartphone features; taking screenshots is one of them. Whether it&#8217;s snagging a digital receipt or an entire how-to webpage for later use, screenshotting is essential.</p>
<p>But there are <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-take-screenshots-android-177316/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many ways to snag a screenshot</a>. We asked <em>Android Authority</em> readers in a <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/screenshots-phone-poll-1215366/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent poll</a> how they accomplish this task. Here&#8217;s what they told us.</p>
<h2>How do you take screenshots on your phone?</h2>
<p><iframe style="border: none;" title="How do you take screenshots on your phone?" src="https://e.infogram.com/15f00c6a-7c62-43d2-a8f6-c458796d671e?src=embed" width="100%" height="497" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Around 1,600 votes were tallied on this one, but there&#8217;s a definite majority. Despite the various methods one can grab a screenshot, pressing the volume-down and power buttons is the most popular. More than 58% of voters prefer this formula which is the most universal way to snag stills on an <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-phones-568001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android phone</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, using voice assistants is the least popular method with just 30 voters (1.9% of the vote) using them instead.</p>
<p>More than one in three readers employ a software shortcut to snag screenshots, while the power button menu or a quick setting garnered just under 8% of the vote. The comments seem in line with this option too, with many users pointing to built-in UI options.</p>
<h2>Here&#8217;s what you told us</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://disq.us/p/2g6lyeh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syamsul Rosli</a>: MIUI three finger swipe.</li>
<li><a href="http://disq.us/p/2g6lux4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tony&#8217;s Texas Hots</a>: Samsung side-of-palm swipe. Works every time.</li>
<li><a href="http://disq.us/p/2g6ln9q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wongwatt</a>: Huawei user so the excellent knuckle tap and draw shortcuts for me.</li>
<li><a href="http://disq.us/p/2g6obbv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eric Pearson</a>: While I am left handed and find the s21 buttons on the perfect place to use the power vol down combo. I have, on occasion, been driving and found the swipe across the screen gesture to be very helpful.</li>
<li><a href="http://disq.us/p/2g70ucu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thesecondsight</a>: Moto three fingers touch &amp; hold the screen.</li>
</ul>
