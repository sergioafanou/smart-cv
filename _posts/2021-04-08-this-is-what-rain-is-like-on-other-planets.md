It's relatively predictable in size and shape, and while we're noticing more extreme weather and lack of rain in some parts of the world (thanks to climate change, which is our fault, by the way), rain itself doesn't change much. As it turns out, the same may be true on other planets, and a new study suggests that while the makeup of precipitation could vary dramatically on alien worlds, the raindrops would look very familiar to human travelers.</p>
<p>The research, which was published in the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020JE006653"><em>Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets</em></a>, suggests that the physics that govern how water droplets form and fall on Earth will likely result in similar precipitation on other planets, even if the makeup of the "rain" is much different. In modeling raindrops falling through the atmospheres of planets like Jupiter and Saturn, which are vastly different from rocky planets like Earth, they found that the type of planet doesn't matter all that much when it comes to rain.</p>
