In a report outlining a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/apple-tv-combined-homepod-camera/">possible Apple TV with a combined HomePod and camera</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-working-on-combined-tv-box-speaker-to-revive-home-efforts"><em>Bloomberg's</em> Mark Gurman says</a> that Apple is exploring a future high-end <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> speaker that could include an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> connected via a robotic arm that tracks and follows users around a room.

From the report:
<br/>
<blockquote>The Cupertino, California-based technology giant, is also mulling the launch of a high-end speaker with a touch screen to better compete with market leaders Google and Amazon.com Inc., the people said. Such a device would combine an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; with a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; speaker and also include a camera for video chat. Apple has explored connecting the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; to the speaker with a robotic arm that can move to follow a user around a room, similar to Amazonâ€™s latest Echo Show gadget.</blockquote>Gurman had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-speakers-with-screens-and-cameras-report/">previously hinted</a> Apple was working on a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a screen and camera as it looks to bolster its smart home lineup. However, today's report builds on that, revealing that the Cupertino tech giant is looking to utilize the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, possibly connected to the speaker via a robotic arm that tracks and follows users during video calls.
<br/>

<br/>
The &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;/&zwnj;iPad&zwnj; combination would work similarly to Amazon's Echo 10, which has a tablet connected to a robotic arm and utilizes facial recognition to keep users in frame during conference calls or when summoned for attention.

<em>Bloomberg</em> notes that the development of this high-end speaker is still very much early in the early stages, calling it a "concept" that could ultimately never see the light of day. Apple recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinuing-homepod/">discontinued its original HomePod</a>, saying that it will instead shift resources to focus on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">Homepod</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg/">Bloomberg</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini">HomePod Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/homepod-ipad-with-robotic-arm/">Bloomberg: Future HomePod May Feature iPad Connected Via Robotic Arm to Track Users Around The Room During FaceTime Calls</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bloomberg-future-homepod-may-feature-ipad-connected-via-robotic-arm-to-track-users-around-the-room-during-facetime-calls.2291424/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
