Nobody wants their dog to be attacked in their own backyard by a tiger on the loose or something, so I totally get it. Still, not every escaped animal wants to cause problems, and some of them might even just want to return to their own instinctual way of doing things rather than interact with humans or their pets at all. In Germany, not one, not two, but two dozen monkeys broke loose from the zoo in Loeffingen and left zoo officials searching for where they might have gone.</p>
<p>Zoo staff responded to reports that the monkeys were traveling together, but were unable to track them down and, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/monkey-escape-germany_n_60717b6fc5b6616dcd78a61d">according to an <em>AP</em> report</a>, eventually lost them entirely. The two dozen Barbay macaques could have done whatever they wanted, including roaming populated areas and messing with whoever they ran into, but they were way too chill to do that. Instead, they ended up not far from the zoo at the edge of a forest. What were these mischievous monkeys up to? Laying in the sun, according to police.</p>
