Apple's upcoming 12.9-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> may be in short supply when it launches due to production issues of the mini-LED display being used in the device, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-facing-supply-shortage-of-upcoming-high-end-ipad-display">Bloomberg</a></em>.

<br/>
Apple suppliers are experiencing poor manufacturing yields of the display, and at least one mini-LED maker has had to pause production of a result of these issues.
<br/>

<br/>
Though there are troubles with mini-LED display manufacturing, Apple is still intending to introduce new 11 and 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models as early as this month, and as prior rumors have suggested, the mini-LED display will be exclusive to the larger 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.

<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mini-led/">Mini-LED</a> technology will offer multiple benefits, such as a better contrast ratio and improved brightness.

<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/thunderbolt-ipad-pro-coming-in-april/">in March said</a> that the refreshed &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models would come as early as April, but there is still no narrower timeline available. It is not clear if the new tablets will be introduced via press release or if Apple has some kind of event in the works, as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> is also expected to see a refresh.
<br/>

<br/>
Along with a mini-LED display, the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models are expected to feature an A14X chip with M1-like performance and Thunderbolt connectivity.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/high-end-ipad-pro-mini-led-production-issue/">Upcoming 12.9-Inch iPad Pro Supplies Could Be Limited Due to Mini-LED Production Issues</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/upcoming-12-9-inch-ipad-pro-supplies-could-be-limited-due-to-mini-led-production-issues.2291394/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
