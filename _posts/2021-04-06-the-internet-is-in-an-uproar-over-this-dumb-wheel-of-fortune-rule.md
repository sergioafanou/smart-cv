Every letter had been revealed except for two, but they weren't necessary. It was clear that the answer to this crossword puzzle-style <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/wheel-of-fortune-contestant-loses-over-technicality-and-fans-arent-having-it-045934522.html"><em>Wheel of Fortune</em> challenge</a> was a set of four words, as you can see in the video below: "Sole, Flounder, Cod, Catfish." That's exactly what Pederson said after declaring that he'd like to solve the puzzle, only to hear longtime <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2021/04/02/wheel-of-fortune-rule-change-mxp-vpx.hln">host Pat Sajak</a> tell him that -- no, unfortunately, Pederson's answer was incorrect.</p>
<p>That's because he'd added an "and," so that what he actually told Sajak was this: "Sole, Flounder, Cod, <em>and</em> Catfish." This revealed a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2021/04/01/wheel-fortune-fans-divided-after-contestant-loses-technicality/4846787001/">technicality</a> that many viewers and even contestants might not be aware has been associated with the popular game show for a few years now. Basically, if the answer to the puzzle is a series of words, you have to say the answer exactly as it appears on the board, without adding something like "and" to the series of words. Pretty stupid, right?</p>
