<li>A new web app from Samsung called &#8220;iTest&#8221; allows iPhone users to use a mock version of Samsung&#8217;s One UI Android skin.</li>
<li>The app is limited, but it generally does a great job in mimicking Android, complete with mock notifications and even access to the Galaxy Store.</li>
<li>iTest is seeing promotion only in New Zealand at the moment, but anyone in the world with an iPhone can check it out now.</li>

<p>Just this week, we told you about a new study revolving around teens in the US and their <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/iphone-us-teens-1216170/">undying love for iPhones</a>. Additionally, Tim Cook recently mentioned during an earnings call that there&#8217;s been a large increase in users leaving Android for the iPhone. Although Android is still the world&#8217;s biggest mobile operating system by a huge margin, it&#8217;s clear that the ship has a leak.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-phones-computers-more-1156543/">Samsung</a> must not have missed this news. Seemingly in response, the world&#8217;s largest smartphone manufacturer quietly launched a new web app for iPhone users (via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/samsung-itest-galaxy-device-iphone-experience/"><em>MacRumors</em></a>). Samsung&#8217;s &#8220;iTest&#8221; app puts a mock version of Android onto an iPhone, giving the user a chance to get a feel for the Samsung Galaxy experience without needing to change hardware.</p>

<p>The free app is seeing some promotions in New Zealand at the moment, but users all over the world can give it a shot. If you have an iPhone 7 or newer, you can <a href="https://itest.nz/">click here</a> to see for yourself.</p>
<h2>Samsung iTest: Almost like the real thing</h2>
<p>According to <em>MacRumors</em>, the iTest app is surprisingly robust. You can open apps, check out the app drawer, and even pay the Galaxy Store a visit. You&#8217;ll even see periodic dummy notifications to get a feel for what the overall experience is.</p>
<p>Of course, there are plenty of limitations. A lot of the apps have little functionality with most just bringing you to a static splash page. Your real notifications will also come in through iOS, not iTest, so that could ruin the experience a bit.</p>

<p>Still, it&#8217;s actually pretty cool to see One UI on an iPhone done this well with no installation necessary. Samsung has no qualms about going for the throat, either. For example, the Galaxy Store puts a lot of focus on the availability of Fortnite — which iPhone users can no longer play.</p>
<p>Time will tell if this strategy actually earns some converts from iOS to Android. However, you gotta hand it to Samsung for coming up with new ways to show iPhone users that things aren&#8217;t all that different on the other side of the fence.</p>
