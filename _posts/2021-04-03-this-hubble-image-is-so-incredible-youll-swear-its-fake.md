It's become so easy to make fake planets, galaxies, and other celestial sights that it's easy to forget how incredible our own totally real universe actually is. NASA's Hubble Space Telescope is always here to remind us, and a new snapshot of the distant Veil Nebula shows us that even the most bloated special effects budget can't compare with what Mother Nature has painted in the cosmos.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2021/hubble-revisits-the-veil-nebula">The image</a>, which was taken at a ridiculous distance of 2,100 light-years from Earth, is absolutely awe-inspiring in every way possible. The nebula you see here is the result of the death of a massive star that is estimated to have been 20 times the mass of our own Sun. That's a whole lot of material being blasted into space, and this swirling mass of gasses is what is left some 10,000 years after the star detonated in a blast that would have decimated anything in its path.</p>
