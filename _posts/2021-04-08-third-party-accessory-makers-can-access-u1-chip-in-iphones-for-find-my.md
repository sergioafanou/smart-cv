Apple today <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/07/apple-announces-find-my-network-third-party-devices/">announced the launch</a> of its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a> network accessory program, which lets third-party accessories integrate with the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app.

<br/>
Initial &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; accessories from VanMoof, Belkin, and Chipolo will work with &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; using Bluetooth, but Apple is developing a U1 specification for chipset makers that will let third-party devices take advantage of the U1 Ultra Wideband chip built into the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/">iPhone 11</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12</a> models.
<br/>

<br/>
According to Apple, third-party accessories that offer Ultra Wideband support for the U1 chip will be able to offer a "more precise, directionally aware experience when nearby," making tracking an item to a specific location easier, especially when that item is close by.
<br/>

<br/>
Items that have Ultra Wideband will be able to be tracked more precisely with devices that have a U1 chip, which includes all of the &zwnj;iPhone 11&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; models.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple's decision to open up access to the U1 chip in the iPhones for &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; will put third-party accessories that integrate Ultra Wideband on par with the rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags</a>. &zwnj;AirTags&zwnj; will feature U1 chip support for more accurate tracking, according to rumors, so Apple will have no specific edge over competitors with the way that the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; program is set up.
<br/>

<br/>
There has been some pushback from Tile on rumors of &zwnj;AirTags&zwnj;, so Apple likely wanted to avoid any kind of situation where it looked like its own accessories were getting special treatment not available to third-party accessories.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple says that its U1 specification will be available to device makers "later this spring," so it will still be some time before we see Ultra Wideband-compatible accessories that work with the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/07/third-party-find-my-devices-u1-chip/">Third-Party Accessory Makers Can Access U1 Chip in iPhones for Find My</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/third-party-accessory-makers-can-access-u1-chip-in-iphones-for-find-my.2290942/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
