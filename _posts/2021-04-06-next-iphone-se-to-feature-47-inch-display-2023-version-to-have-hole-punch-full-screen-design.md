The next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> that's set to launch in 2022 will feature the same 4.7-inch display as the current version, according to display analyst Ross Young.

<br/>
The existing &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is modeled after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 8 with a 4.7-inch display. There were rumors suggesting that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/05/kuo-iphone-without-lightning-connector-2021/">was working on</a> an "&zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; Plus" that could come out this year, but earlier this month, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that there <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-iphone-se-2022-5g/">won't be a new iPhone</a> in the SE family until 2022.

<br/>
Young's information also suggests there will be no 2021 refresh for the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;, but he says that following the minor 2022 refresh, there could be a more radical design change coming in 2023.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple is said to be working on a 6.1-inch version of the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; that features a hole punch design rather than a notch. Apple is rumored to be planning to bring the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-some-2022-iphones-punch-hole-display/">hole punch display</a> to the 2022 flagship models, so it makes sense that after introducing new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 models with the design change, it could trickle down to the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; a year later.
<br/>

<br/>
The hole punch design is something that Android manufacturers have been using for some time to maximize available display area while also leaving space for the front-facing camera. On Apple's devices, the hole punch will replace the current notch.
<br/>

<br/>
Though there will presumably be few design changes to the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; coming in 2022, the device is expected to get an upgraded processor and 5G support, which Young says may be limited to sub-6GHz.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE 2020</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Caution)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/01/iphone-se-2023-hole-punch-design/">Next iPhone SE to Feature 4.7-Inch Display, 2023 Version to Have Hole Punch Full Screen Design</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-iphone-se-to-feature-4-7-inch-display-2023-version-to-have-hole-punch-full-screen-design.2290330/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
