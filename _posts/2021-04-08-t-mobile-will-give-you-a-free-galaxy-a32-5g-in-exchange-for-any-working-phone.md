<li>A new T-Mobile long-term promotion will give you a free phone with 5G support in exchange for any working phone.</li>
<li>The Free 5G Phone Upgrade program will last throughout all of 2021. The first phone on offer is the Samsung Galaxy A32.</li>
<li>Additionally, AT&amp;T and Verizon customers can switch to T-Mobile for unlimited 5G access at the same price they currently pay.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today, T-Mobile threw <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/un-carrier/t-mobiles-next-un-carrier-move-5gforall">a new Uncarrier event</a>. These sporadic events are where the US wireless carrier announces big new changes to its services. Unsurprisingly, the big announcements revolve around 5G.</p>
<p>The biggest boon for customers is a new long-term promotion called The Free 5G Phone Upgrade. The promotion — which starts April 18 and lasts all the way until the end of 2021 — allows anyone to trade in a working phone and get <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-5g-phones-926740/">a 5G-capable phone</a> in return.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Related: </strong><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-t-mobile-plans-786372/">T-Mobile buyer&#8217;s guide: Plans, perks, and more</a></p>
<p>To start, you can bring a working phone to a T-Mobile store and the reps there will hand you a <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-a52-a42-a32-us-availability-price-1215227/">Samsung Galaxy A32</a>. Throughout the year, the free phone on offer might change, but the promotion won&#8217;t. T-Mobile will accept any working phone of any kind and from any year.</p>
<p>Obviously, you&#8217;ll need to sign up for T-Mobile postpaid service for this to work and you&#8217;ll need to keep that service for two years or you&#8217;ll be stuck paying for the phone. However, this promotion also applies to existing customers. That means current T-Mobile users could bring in whatever 4G-only phone they&#8217;re using now and get a 5G-capable budget phone for free.</p>
<p>This free phone promotion ties in nicely with another new offer&#8230;</p>
<h2>The Great Unlimited 5G Trade-Up</h2>
<p>T-Mobile&#8217;s second announcement today is the launch of The Great Unlimited 5G Trade-Up. This promotion goes after current <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/att-plans-785600/">AT&amp;T</a> and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-verizon-plans-1141575/">Verizon</a> customers who either have zero or limited access to 5G. If you&#8217;re one of the 60 million Americans on a limited data plan, you can switch to T-Mobile and get an unlimited data plan — including unlimited 5G access — for the same or better price as what you&#8217;re paying now.</p>
<p>The limitations here are you can only have up to six lines and you will need to prove what you currently pay to AT&amp;T or Verizon. Bringing a recent bill to a T-Mobile store will do the trick. If you don&#8217;t verify within two weeks of signing up, your plan will default to the Essentials plan at full price (currently $26 per line for a four-line account).</p>
<p>Thankfully, this promotion also applies to current T-Mobile customers. If you are currently on a limited postpaid T-Mobile plan, you will get upgraded to an unlimited plan at no extra cost. Prepaid customers won&#8217;t see any changes, though.</p>
<p>The Great Unlimited 5G Trade-Up also starts on April 18 and lasts throughout all of 2021. These promotions work hand-in-hand, too, meaning you can take advantage of both if you fit all the criteria.</p>
