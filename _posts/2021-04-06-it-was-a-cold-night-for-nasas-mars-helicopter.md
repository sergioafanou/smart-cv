The Mars Helicopter &mdash; named "Ingenuity," in case you were wondering &mdash; rode along with Perseverance during its journey to Mars. The helicopter was folded up and attached to the rover's belly, and now that Perseverance has traveled to the designated "Mars airstrip" that NASA picked out, it's time for the tiny aircraft to be set free.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-s-mars-helicopter-survives-first-cold-martian-night-on-its-own">a new blog post</a>, NASA reveals that the rover deposited the unfolded helicopter onto the surface where it had to spend its first Martian night alone. The 4-inch drop went well, and the helicopter is now positioned perfectly for its eventual takeoff, but first, it has to endure the harsh Martian weather for a number of days.</p>
