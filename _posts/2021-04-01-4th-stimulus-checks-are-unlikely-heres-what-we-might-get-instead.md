It was a breathtakingly dramatic response to the still-new <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-updates-03-31-21/index.html">COVID-19 pandemic</a> that most us probably at the time didn't think we'd still be dealing with the effects of more than a year later. And how extraordinary it would have felt -- again, at the time -- if we'd have known then that not one but two more stimulus checks would be sent out to Americans as a consequence of the financial impact of the pandemic being so terrible?</p>
<p>At any rate, the call has already begun for Americans to be sent a new stimulus check for the fourth time, with a group of Democratic senators earlier this week led by Oregon's Ron Wyden writing to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/30/stimulus-check-update-senators-push-biden-to-send-recurring-payments.html">President Biden</a>: &ldquo;We urge you to include recurring direct payments and automatic unemployment insurance extensions tied to economic conditions in your Build Back Better long-term economic plan."</p>
