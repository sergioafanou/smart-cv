<p><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/xiaomi-1158659/">Xiaomi</a> finally made the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/xiaomi-mi-11-series-1212330/">Mi 11 Ultra</a> official earlier this week, giving us a full-blown premium flagship phone. Between the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-waterproof-phones-718588/">IP68</a> rating, impressive rear camera setup, and big battery, it&#8217;s clear Xiaomi is targeting Samsung, Apple, and other ~$1,000 players with this device.</p>
<p>But what do <em>Android Authority</em> readers think of the phone now that it&#8217;s been announced with a €1,200 (~$1,408) price tag? We asked readers whether the phone was hot or not, and here&#8217;s how they voted.</p>
<h2>Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra: Hot or not?</h2>
<p><iframe style="border: none;" title="Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra hot or not" src="https://e.infogram.com/1326da6b-c0d9-403a-a488-e9662a5eb583?src=embed" width="100%" height="497" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A grand total of 2,589 votes were cast in <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-hot-or-not-poll-1213223/">this poll</a>, and just over 80% of respondents felt that the Mi 11 Ultra was indeed hot. It&#8217;s understandable why people think the phone is a great proposition though. Aside from the aforementioned premium features, you&#8217;re also getting 67W wired/wireless charging, that neat secondary rear screen, and a top-notch main screen.</p>
<p>Just under 19% of polled readers voted for &#8220;not&#8221; though. Presumably the €1,200 price tag drove these users away from the device, although one comment points to the presence of a punch-hole cutout and another pointed to the phone&#8217;s weight.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>More Xiaomi coverage:</strong> <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-xiaomi-phones-2-833837/">These are the best Xiaomi phones you can buy</a></p>
<p>We actually ran a poll <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-poll-results-1201651/">back in February</a> when the phone first leaked, and pricing wasn&#8217;t known. The results at the time showed that 79.4% of respondents thought the phone was hot, so there is a negligible increase with the latest poll. These latest results suggest Xiaomi might be doing a solid job of pricing the flagship. It&#8217;s worth noting that the similarly equipped <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-series-1147733/">Galaxy S21 Ultra</a> retails for €1,249 (~$1,467) in Europe.</p>
<p>Xiaomi is also set to launch the Mi 11 Ultra in India on April 23, and we&#8217;ll definitely be interested to see what kind of pricing it has in mind for the market.</p>

<li><a href="https://disqus.com/by/fat8893/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-action="profile" data-username="fat8893">Farhan Ahmad Tajuddin</a>: 8K video resolution for ultrawide and telephoto camera does sound enticing, but 8K adoption is still far from wide. So maybe, the Pro variant is more than good enough since it still has the same Samsung ISOCELL GN2 main camera sensor as in the Ultra.</li>
