For example, Walmart+ made its debut last fall, giving shoppers the option to pay $98 a year for free delivery, a new Scan &amp; Go feature in the Walmart app, and fuel discounts. Now, Best Buy is following suit with its own service, but this one is the most expensive yet.</p>
<p>Starting on Wednesday, April 7th in select markets, Best Buy is kicking off a pilot of its new Best Buy Beta membership program which will give subscribers access to "exclusive member pricing, unlimited Geek Squad technical support, up to two years of protection on most product purchases, free standard shipping and delivery, and free installation on most products and appliances." Here's the kicker: Best Buy Beta costs $199 a year.</p>
