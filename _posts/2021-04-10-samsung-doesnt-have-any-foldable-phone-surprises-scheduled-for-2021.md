Other smartphone makers released dual-screen handsets (<a href="https://bgr.com/2020/08/14/surface-duo-price-android-updates-guarantee-three-years/">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://bgr.com/2020/09/14/lg-wing-price-release-date-specs-official/">LG</a>), rollable phones (<a href="https://bgr.com/2021/02/23/oppo-x-2021-rollable-phone-technology-explained/">Oppo</a> and <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/04/05/lg-rollable-release-date-never-lg-closes-mobile-division/">LG</a>), and showed off foldable concepts of their own.</p>
<p>But Samsung was the first mainstream smartphone maker to reveal a foldable handset, and the first to launch two different form-factors. Several reports claim that Samsung wants to increase foldable phone sales significantly. Its <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/04/02/galaxy-z-fold-2-deal-60-day-trial-price-cut/">recent moves</a> show that the company is looking to make foldable phones more affordable to interested buyers. But a new rumor indicates that Samsung doesn&rsquo;t have any exciting foldable surprises in store for 2021.</p>
