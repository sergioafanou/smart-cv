<p>Indonesia&#8217;s e-commerce enabler SIRCLO announced today it has acquired local parenting platform Orami for an undisclosed amount.</p>
<p>Post-acquisition, Orami will operate as an independent entity that will be integrated within SIRCLO&#8217;s line of services.</p>
<p>SIRCLO will leverage its technical capability as well as infrastructure to strengthen the enabler services and bridge brands to a broader consumer base.</p>
<p>At the same time, Orami&#8217;s role within SIRCLO will be to serve as the extended effort to make that mission a reality &#8212; with a strength that lies in the community network of mothers who actively shop for their parenting needs through e-commerce.</p>
<p>As per the deal, Orami CEO Ferry Tenka Tenka and President Hendrawan Kartika will take on the roles of SIRCLO&#8217;s CMO and CFO, respectively.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013, SIRCLO helps businesses across various scales sell online. It claims to have served over 100,000 well-known brands across 34 provinces in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Last year, SIRCLO claims to have recorded up to a four-fold transaction surge, owing to changes in consumer behaviour that took place during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Orami is a Jakarta-Indonesia-based company that enables the combination of parenting content, commerce, and community under one ecosystem.</p>

<p>Backed by the likes of Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, Ardent Capital, and Velos Partners, Orami claims to be recording over five million monthly active users.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see this synergy as a really big opportunity to accelerate Orami&#8217;s growth. In parallel, it enables us to accommodate the needs of brands and consumers,&#8221; said Tenka.</p>
<p>&#8220;This corporate action can expand the enabler services that SIRCLO offers to brand owners who are seeking to enter the online market. Orami has a shopping site that facilitates established brands from the mom and baby category in selling their products. Therefore, we have a joint mission to combine our strengths in helping brands sell online in a more strategic, scalable, and efficient manner,&#8221; SIRCLO founder Brian Marshal added.</p>
