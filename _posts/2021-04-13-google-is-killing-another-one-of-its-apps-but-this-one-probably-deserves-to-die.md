The apps will continue to function through June, but they will stop working after that.</p>
<p>"Within the next few weeks, we&rsquo;ll no longer be supporting the Shopping app," a Google spokesperson told <em>9to5Google</em> when asked about the impending shutdown. "All of the functionality the app offered users is available on the Shopping tab. We&rsquo;ll continue building features within the Shopping tab and other Google surfaces, including the Google app, that make it easy for people to discover and shop for the products they love."</p>
