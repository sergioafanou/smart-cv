Four months after Apple first began requiring apps to add App Privacy labels to their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> listings, Google has finally updated all of its most popular apps with the information, letting people know exactly what data Google is collecting.
<br/>

<br/>
Google began adding App Privacy labels to its apps in February <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/20/google-ios-apps-still-no-privacy-labels/">after months of delaying</a>. Gmail, for example, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/google-gmail-app-privacy-labels/">got App Privacy labels</a> on February 22, and other apps have been slowly updated over time.
<br/>

<br/>
Google Maps was quietly updated with privacy information last week, and as noted by <em><a href="https://the8-bit.com/google-update-popular-ios-apps-with-privacy-nutritionn-labels-ios-14/">The 8-Bit</a></em>, Google today updated its last main app with App Privacy details, adding the information to Google <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>.
<br/>

<br/>
As a consequence of taking so long to add App Privacy labels, many of Google's apps <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/google-hasnt-updated-ios-apps-since-privacy-labels/">went months</a> without an update. Apple began enforcing App Privacy labels on December 8, and any new app or app update submitted after that time had to include the information.

<br/>
Back in February, it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/gmail-ios-out-of-date-warning/">had been two months</a> since Gmail was updated, and the app started giving users a warning that it was out of date and should be updated, but there was, of course, no update available. Gmail was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/gmail-ios-updated/">finally updated</a> on March 1.
<br/>

<br/>
Though Google &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; and Google Maps now have App Privacy labels, the apps still have yet to be updated. It's been four months since Google Maps and Google &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; got bug fixes or new features, which is highly unusual as Google typically pushes regular updates.
<br/>

<br/>
It's not clear why Google delayed adding App Privacy labels to its apps for so long as it isn't exactly a surprise that the company is collecting quite a bit of data from users. Google Maps, for example, uses coarse location, search history, browsing history, identifiers, and usage data for third-party advertising purposes, with Google Search using much of the same information.
<br/>

<br/>
All of the data that Google is collecting is now listed in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; for each individual app for those who are interested.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-maps/">Google Maps</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/gmail/">Gmail</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-photos/">Google Photos</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/06/google-apps-privacy-label-updates/">All of Google&#039;s Main Apps Now Feature Privacy Labels</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-of-googles-main-apps-now-feature-privacy-labels.2290819/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
