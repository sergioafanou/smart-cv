Apple today seeded the seventh beta of an upcoming watchOS 7.4 update to developers for testing purposes, with the new beta coming one week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/31/apple-seeds-watchos-7-4-beta-6-to-developers/">release of the sixth beta</a> and over two months after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/26/apple-releases-watchos-7-3/">launch of watchOS 7.3</a> with "Time to Walk" functionality, expanded ECG availability, and a new Unity watch face.

<br/>
To install the ‌watchOS 7.4 beta, developers need to download the proper configuration profile from the Apple Developer Center. Once the profile is in place, the watchOS 7.4 beta can be downloaded through the dedicated ‌Apple Watch‌ app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> by going to General > Software Update.
<br/>

<br/>
To update to the new software, the ‌Apple Watch‌ needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it must be in range of the ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌.
<br/>

<br/>
Alongside iOS 14.5, watchOS 7.4 introduces a new "Unlock with Apple Watch" feature that lets an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with Face ID use an unlocked and authenticated Apple Watch as a secondary authentication measure when you're wearing a mask, alleviating the need to enter a passcode to unlock the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.
<br/>

<br/>
Face ID does not work when wearing a mask, but this new Apple Watch feature provides an easy but still secure way to access the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; without the hassle of a passcode. It's similar to the Apple Watch unlocking on Mac and can be enabled in the Settings app under Face ID & Passcode.
<br/>

<br/>
An unlocked Apple Watch paired with Face ID can unlock the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; when a mask is worn, but it's only for mask usage. The Apple Watch cannot be used to authenticate <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> purchases, nor can it be used to unlock apps that require a Face ID scan. In these situations, the mask will need to be removed or a passcode/password will need to be used instead.

<br/>
When the Apple Watch unlocks the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, you'll feel a haptic tap on the wrist and will receive a notification on the watch, similar to how it works when using the watch to unlock a Mac.
<br/>

<br/>
For those who use Apple Fitness+, the watchOS 7.4 update combined with iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5 enables <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> 2 for Apple Fitness+, so workouts can be streamed to an &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; 2-enabled TV or set-top box. Apple Watch metrics do not show up on the screen when AirPlayed, however, and that feature is limited to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;/<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>/<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 6</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/07/watchos-7-4-beta-7/">Apple Seeds Seventh Beta of watchOS 7.4 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-seventh-beta-of-watchos-7-4-to-developers.2290935/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
