Aside from a distinctive appearance, the design will also make the device easier to hold and less likely to slip out of one's hands. If an iPhone with a matte back finish is actually in the cards, there's a good chance this new color option will only be available on the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max models.</p>
<p>"The matte back is getting refined," <em>EverythingApplePro</em> reported a few weeks back. "So in the 2021 iPhones, I&rsquo;m sure Max is referring to the Pro models, they&rsquo;ll have a slightly more grippy texturized back. He says they&rsquo;ll be slightly more comfortable and he assumes it&rsquo;ll be like a soft matte, like on the Pixel series."</p>
