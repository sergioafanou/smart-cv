<ul>
<li>WhatsApp could soon let you transfer your chat history to a different phone number.</li>
<li>The feature is reportedly in the works for both Android and iOS users.</li>
<li>Currently, your WhatsApp chats are tied to your phone number.</li>
</ul>
<p></div><hr></p>
<p>Earlier this month, we got some <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/whatsapp-device-syncing-1223855/">information</a> about how WhatsApp&#8217;s chat migration and sync feature might work across multiple devices. Now, details of how the messaging platform could further improve the feature have emerged.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-to-support-chat-history-migration-to-a-different-phone-number/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WABetaInfo</a> —</em> a website dedicated to hunting for new <a href="/how-to-use-whatsapp-1097088/">WhatsApp features</a> — reports that the Facebook-owned service might soon let users transfer their chats to a different phone number.</p>
<p>Currently, if you want to restore a backup of your WhatsApp chats, your phone needs to have the same number and operating system as your older device. While chat migration from Android to iOS is already in testing, WhatsApp may also be looking to enable users to move their messages to a new phone number.</p>
<p>A screenshot from WhatsApp&#8217;s iOS-Android migration tool shows an option to transfer chats to a different phone number. It also shows that you won&#8217;t be able to migrate chat history at any time. You can only start the process when you link a new Android phone to your WhatsApp account.</p>

<p>Along with your chats, WhatsApp will also migrate media files to the alternate phone number.</p>
<p>The process to change your WhatsApp phone number should begin before you start migrating your chat history.</p>
<p><em>WABetaInfo</em> also reports that the feature is currently under development for both Android and iOS phones. It should be available through a future update.</p>
