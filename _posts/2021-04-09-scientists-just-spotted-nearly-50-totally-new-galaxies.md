Earth is part of a planet-moon system that is part of the larger solar system. The solar system revolves around a single star in the Milky Way galaxy. The Milky Way galaxy is home to at least 100 billion stars and perhaps as many as 400 billion... and it's just one galaxy. Now, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00004">in a new research paper</a>, a team of astronomers has announced the discovery of 44 entirely new galaxies, each containing an untold number of stars, planets, moons, and you. Wait, not you, but everything else before that.</p>
<p>The researchers used data from a variety of sources to hunt for previously undetected galaxies hiding in a region of space called the Fornax Cluster. The Fornax Cluster is a, well, cluster of galaxies that sit some 65 million light-years from Earth and has been a huge source of galaxy discoveries in the past. In this case, data from multiple surveys and observational campaigns was used to reveal the presence of 44 new galaxies, but they aren't anything like the Milky Way.</p>
