<h2>Samsung Galaxy S20 FE updates</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current stable version</strong>: Android 10</li>
<li><strong>When will the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE get Android 11?</strong> Rolling out now</li>
</ul>
<p>Samsung originally launched the Galaxy S20 FE on October 2, 2020. Pre-orders kicked off in late September with sales commencing on launch day. The phone debuted with Android 10-based <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-one-ui-2-5-1141505/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One UI 2.5</a>.</p>
<p>Although the Galaxy S20 FE ticked all the right boxes as an affordable Samsung flagship, the device did face a notable issue post-launch. Some users <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-display-problems-1167388/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported problems</a> with the phone&#8217;s screen sensitivity and performance. Samsung pushed <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s20-fe-display-updates-1171315/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two updates</a> in October with hopes to address the issue</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-touchscreen-problems-1176238/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">third update</a> – firmware version G781BXXU1ATK1 – was distributed in November. The update also brought with it the November security patch for Android. Per comments on social media and forums, these three updates didn&#8217;t resolve the issues for several S20 FE owners.</p>

<p>In early December 2020, a <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-android-11-update-1182706/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One UI 3.0 update roadmap</a> for Germany was published by Samsung. The list included the Galaxy S20 FE but earmarked its update for January 2021 — a month later than its <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-1062433/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy S20 series</a> siblings.</p>
<p>On December 18, 2020, a report from <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s20-fe-one-ui-3-0-stable-update-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>SamMobile</em></a> suggested that some users in Russia are already receiving the stable <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-one-ui-3-0-1158180/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One UI 3.0</a> update. The patch was numbered G780FXXU1BTL1 and includes the December 2020 Android security update.</p>
<p>Samsung users received the gift of a stable One UI 3.0 update on December 25, 2020. Per <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s20-fe-android-11-update-just-went-truly-global" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>SamMobile</em></a>, the updates bore firmware numbers G780FXXU1BTL1 and G781BXXU1BTL4 for the 4G and 5G models, respectively.</p>
<p>Samsung kicked off its One UI 3.1 update rollout in early February, but abruptly pulled the update a day later. The update included firmware version G781BXXU2CUB5 to the device and weighed in at around 1.7GB. The company <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s21-fe-one-ui-3-1-update-rolling-out-again" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resumed</a> the update on February 19, featuring the same<span class="post-body"> version number as before (G781BXXU2CUB5).</span></p>
<p>The Galaxy S20 FE gained a <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s20-fe-gets-galaxy-s21-camera-features-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slew of updates</a> to its camera system in March. The update, numbered G781BXXU2CUC6, brought Galaxy S21 series features to the phone, including new portrait mode effects and the ability to use the ultra-wide camera in Pro mode to the budget flagship.</p>
