<p>Traveloka, the Indonesian travel unicorn, is in advanced talks to go public through a merger with Bridgetown Holdings, the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) backed by Peter Thiel, a <em>Bloomberg</em> <a rel="follow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/traveloka-said-in-talks-to-list-via-richard-li-s-bridgetown-spac">report</a> said citing unnamed sources.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> had in December <a rel="follow" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/traveloka-ipo/southeast-asia-travel-app-traveloka-weighs-public-listing-options-idINKBN28V1AB">reported</a> that Traveloka was eyeing to go public and was evaluating a merger with a SPAC as a possible listing option.</p>
<p>This new report comes even as Grab, another Southeast Asian tech unicorn, <a rel="follow" rel="follow" href="https://e27.co/grab-set-to-list-in-the-us-through-us35b-spac-merger-report-20210409/">is said to be working on listing</a> on the New York Stock Exchange through a US$35 billion merger with SPAC Altimeter Capital.</p>
<p>As per <em>Bloomberg&#8217;s</em> sources, a deal could value Jakarta-headquartered Traveloka at about US$5 billion. The potential transaction could also involve raising between US$500 million and US$750 million through a private investment in public equity.</p>
