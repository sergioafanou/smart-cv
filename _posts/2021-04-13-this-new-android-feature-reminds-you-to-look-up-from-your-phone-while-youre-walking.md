You get texts and calls, you need to check out navigation instructions, and then comes the endless list of notifications begging you to look at the screen. Spend too much time staring while walking, and you risk colliding with others, bumping into buildings and road signs, or wandering right into traffic. Google is aware of the problem, and has been working on a new feature that all distracted walkers could benefit from.</p>
