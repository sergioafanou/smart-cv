The latest attempt from Samsung is admittedly one of the more clever stabs we've ever seen, as the Galaxy maker released a web app this week that allows iPhone owners to emulate Android as it would appear on a Galaxy phone.</p>
<p>If you visit <a href="https://itest.nz/">Samsung's iTest website</a> on your computer, you will see a QR code that you can scan with your iPhone's camera app. You can also just visit <a href="https://itest.nz/">iTest.nz</a> on your iPhone, but either way, you'll need to load the site in Safari in order to move forward. Once the site is open in Safari on your phone, you will be instructed to tap the center icon at the bottom of the screen, scroll down, and tap&nbsp;<em>Add to Home Screen</em>. You can name the web app whatever you want, and the icon will then pop up next to all of your other apps. Tap on it to "sample the other side."</p>
