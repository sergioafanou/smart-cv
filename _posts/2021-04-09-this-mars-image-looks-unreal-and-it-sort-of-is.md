I know that's hard to believe since you normally see Mars in dusty, vaguely orangish hues in photos snapped by NASA's Mars rovers, but it's true! This image, by contrast, has some orange along with shades of white and a surprising amount of blue, but how can this be? Well, have a seat dear science fan as we go on a magical journey to the world of false-color images.</p>
<p>What you see here is an image captured by NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter. The spacecraft has been cruising around Mars for two decades and is now officially "the longest-working Mars spacecraft in history," according to the space agency. It's a lovely little spacecraft but this image of Mars wasn't captured in color. Instead, the color comes from an algorithm that assigns blue hues to colder temperatures and orange colors to warmer temperatures. This produces a really striking image, but not necessarily an accurate representation of what you'd see if you were looking at this spot on Mars with your own eyes.</p>
