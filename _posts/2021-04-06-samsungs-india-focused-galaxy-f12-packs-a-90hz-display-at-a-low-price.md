<li>Samsung has introduced the Galaxy F12, which offers a 90Hz display for Rs 9,999.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll also get a large 6,000mAh battery and quad cameras.</li>
<li>The Galaxy F02s is also available with a few tradeoffs for Rs 8,999.</li>

<p>The days of paying a premium for a <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/phone-refresh-rate-90hz-120hz-1086643/">high refresh rate display</a> are well and truly over. Samsung has <a href="https://news.samsung.com/in/samsung-india-launches-fullonfab-galaxy-f12-with-true-48mp-quad-camera-and-90hz-display">introduced</a> the Galaxy F12, an India-focused entry-level phone that includes a 90Hz display for a regular starting price of Rs 10,999 (about $150).</p>
<p>The 6.5-inch &#8220;HD+&#8221; screen is otherwise unspectacular, but that still makes the Galaxy F12 a potentially very solid pick for modest gaming and video viewing. The eight-core, 2GHz Exynos 850 chip, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of non-expandable storage (128GB for Rs 11,999) are appropriate for this phone class, if not much more.</p>

<p>You may be more impressed by the rest of the design. The Galaxy F12 carries a very large 6,000mAh battery  — and yes, there&#8217;s a 15W USB-C charger <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-in-box-chargers-1193237/">in the box</a>.  You&#8217;ll also find a quad rear camera array that includes a 48MP ISOCELL GM2 main shooter, a 5MP ultra-wide cam, a 2MP depth sensor, and a 2MP macro camera. An 8MP front-facing camera handles selfies.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t need the F12&#8217;s perks, you can also buy the equally new Galaxy F02s. It offers a 60Hz 6.5-inch display, a 5,000mAh battery (again, charger included), a Snapdragon 450 chip, and a triple rear camera setup that includes a 13MP primary cam along with 2MP depth and macro sensors. You&#8217;ll be stuck with Android 10 at first, though. It starts at Rs 8,999 ($123) for a version with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, although you can pay Rs 9,999 (about $137) to upgrade to 4GB of RAM and 64GB of space.</p>
<p>The Galaxy F02s will be available first, going on sale through Flipkart, Samsung, and other outlets on April 9 at 12PM local time, The Galaxy F12 will arrive on April 12. The pricing may make them tougher sells than rivals like the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/poco-m3-review-1198097/">Poco M3</a>, which boasts a larger, sharper display and expandable storage. However, a 90Hz display is still uncommon at this price — that&#8217;s worth considering even if it might involve a few tradeoffs.</p>
