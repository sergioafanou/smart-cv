<li>Roku has unveiled the Express 4k Plus, a budget player that boasts more powerful hardware capable of HDR.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s also the first device to ship with the simpler, more powerful Roku OS 10.</li>
<li>The Plus ships in mid-May for $39.99, while a new remote and the Streambar Pro are also on deck.</li>

<p>One of <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/roku-streaming-player-1042389/">Roku&#8217;s</a> most affordable media hubs just became much more capable. Roku has <a href="https://newsroom.roku.com/news/2021/04/roku-introduces-powerful-roku-express-4k-and-rechargeable/ltagg-h2-1618319457">introduced</a> the Express 4K Plus, an upgrade to the base Express that adds 4K HDR (in HDR10 and HDR10 Plus) as well as greater overall performance and a fresh interface.</p>
<p>The faster quad-core processor, dual-band Wi-Fi and extra onboard storage in the Express 4K Plus help not just with playback, but improved channel load times. You&#8217;ll also get a voice remote and the latest ecosystem support, including control from Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple&#8217;s HomeKit.</p>
<p>Software might play as much of a role as the hardware. The Express 4K Plus is the first Roku player to debut with OS 10, which promises a more powerful but streamlined experience. The most practical upgrade may be Instant Resume – you can quickly hop back to the last place in a given channel. The feature is currently limited to supporting channels like AT&amp;T TV, Starz, and The Roku Channel, but more are expected in the future.</p>

<p>Setup should also be easier with automatic Wi-Fi detection, recognition of game consoles on Roku TVs and voice entry for some on-screen keyboards. You can customize the live TV guide in the US by adding favorite channels or hiding others, and voice searches provide more visual and comprehensive results.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll get more raw capability. OS 10 brings AirPlay 2 and HomeKit to HD-only Roku devices, not just UHD hardware like the Express 4K Plus. HDR10+ is similarly new to the Express 4K family and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/roku-ultra-review-1210785/">the Ultra</a>. Virtual Surround, meanwhile, enables immersive sound for Roku soundbars.</p>
<p>The Express 4K Plus will be available mid-May for $39.99. A sibling, the Express 4K, will ship with a basic remote and goes on sale for $35 in the US, Canada, Mexico, and the UK over the course of the &#8220;coming weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>A $29.99 Voice Remote Pro is available now and solves some of the key gripes with the standard control, including a USB-rechargeable battery, a lost remote finder and hands-free voice. If you want upgraded sound, a $179.99 Streambar Pro evolves the Smart Soundbar with a voice-capable remote and support for Virtual Surround. It goes on sale through Roku&#8217;s site in late May, and reaches retailers in June.</p>
