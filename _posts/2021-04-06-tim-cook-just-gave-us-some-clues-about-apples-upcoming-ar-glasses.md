Games set in your living room, measuring apps, and home design apps are among the types of applications that make use of AR capabilities built into iOS. But that&rsquo;s just barely scratching the surface of what AR could do. Perhaps the most exciting use of AR on iPhone comes from Google&rsquo;s Maps app, which has <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/03/30/google-maps-features-ai-eco-friendly-navigation-live-view-indoors/">a Live View directions feature</a> that shows navigation data over a live stream of the real world.</p>
<p>No matter how big or small the AR features are, we can&rsquo;t experience them without looking through a screen. The iPhone and iPad are Apple&rsquo;s only AR devices right now, but it's not an ideal AR experience. AR glasses would be a better tool, and it so happens that Apple is reportedly developing two different kinds of headsets that would power AR content. Apple might not be ready to confirm anything until the products are ready for mass consumption, but Tim Cook just explained in an interview how the AR glasses might work.</p>
