Unfortunately, that is precisely what appears to have happened, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/facebook-ran-ads-for-a-fake-clubhouse-for-pc-app-planted-with-malware/"><em>TechCrunch</em> reports</a> that cybercriminals have been taking out ads on Facebook for a fake "Clubhouse for PC" app that is actually filled with dangerous malware.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, unnamed sources alerted <em>TechCrunch</em> that multiple Facebook pages were running ads advertising a supposed PC version of the Clubhouse app, which is a drop-in audio chat app currently only available on iPhone. Anyone who clicks the ad on Facebook is redirected to a website that purports to be run by the team behind Clubhouse, complete with a fake screenshot of the non-existent PC port and a link to download the scam app.</p>
