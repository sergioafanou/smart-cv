And with good reason, every EV that preceded it -- with the exception of Tesla's own Roadster -- was something of an eyesore that was either too clunky, weird-looking, or downright ugly.</p>
<p>The difference in EV design today compared to years past is, without exaggeration, night and day. From the aforementioned Model S to the Porsche Taycan and 2020 Jaguar I-Pace, it's now possible to purchase an EV that is both luxurious and well-designed. And while not every EV today is a sight to behold -- the Chevy Volt still exists, for example -- the EV options today are substantially more attractive than what was even available just a few years ago.</p>
