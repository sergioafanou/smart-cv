<li>Today, the price of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 drops to $200 less than it cost at launch.</li>
<li>Even with that huge discount, the phone is still crazy expensive at $1,800.</li>
<li>Additionally, Samsung is launching a referral program that can slash an extra $100 off.</li>
</ul>

<p>Without question, the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-1135368/">Galaxy Z Fold 2</a> is the best premium foldable on the market. Although there are others out there like it — including the just-launched <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-1213016/">Xiaomi Mi Mix Fold</a> and the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-mate-x2-review-1210103/">Huawei Mate X2</a> — nothing else can top the Fold 2&#8217;s availability, apps, and features.</p>
<p>Of course, the phone is insanely expensive, with a launch price of $2,000. However, Samsung today officially announced that it is permanently dropping the price of the foldable by $200, bringing it down to <a href="https://andauth.co/GalaxyZFold2-O">$1,800</a>. That&#8217;s still a pretty penny, but at least it should cause less sticker shock.</p>

<p>You can grab a Z Fold 2 at its new price from <a href="https://andauth.co/GalaxyZFold2-O">Samsung.com</a>. It&#8217;s also available from <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/att-plans-785600/">AT&amp;T</a> and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-verizon-plans-1141575/">Verizon</a> here in the United States.</p>
<p>Do you already own a Galaxy Z Fold 2 or have a friend who does? If so, you could earn a $100 Samsung credit or get an extra $100 slashed off the price of a new Fold 2. Read on for the details.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 and Galaxy Z Flip referral program</h2>
<p>In the US, Samsung is launching a brand new referral system for its major foldable phones. The way it works is fairly simple. If you own a Galaxy Z foldable and convince a friend to get one directly from Samsung, your friend will save an extra $100 off the phone. This all works through a referral code you get through the Samsung Members app. In return, you will get a free $100 credit on Samsung.com that you can apply to various Samsung products.</p>
<p>The only real caveat here is that you must live in the United States (all 50 states and Washington, D.C.) and must be over 18. Obviously, you must also own a Galaxy Z foldable and have it connected to a Samsung account.</p>
<p>This would be a great way to help a friend get a foldable at a hefty discount. A Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 would come down to $1,700 and a Galaxy Z Flip would come down to $1,100.</p>
