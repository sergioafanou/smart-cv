Apple has adjusted the trade-in values of a number of its products, including the majority of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and Mac lineup, while also making some changes to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.

<br/>
Apple's trade-in program allows customers to trade-in older devices, and receive a certain amount of value for them, to use towards a purchase of a new device. The exact trade-in value a device has is measured by its condition, when it was released, and its manufacturer. Apple last <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/17/apple-adjusts-trade-in-prices-for-watch-ipad-mac/">notably updated its trade-in prices</a> in December, and furthermore, it has made some more changes over the weekend. 
<br/>

<br/>
It's important to note that the value shown on Apple's website reflects the maximum possible trade-in value for a product.
<br/>

<br/>
On the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; lineup, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> has had its value go up by &#36;45 to &#36;580, versus the previous &#36;535. The standard &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; trade-in value has gone down by &#36;15 to &#36;235. In the Mac family, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> is now valued at &#36;530, down from &#36;600. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/09/apple-discontinues-12-inch-macbook/">discontinued MacBook</a> is down by &#36;40 to &#36;340, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/19/imac-pro-officially-discontinued/">discontinued iMac Pro</a> is valued at &#36;2,940, down &#36;100. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> value has had a reduction by &#36;130 to &#36;1,050, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> down &#36;60, to a value of &#36;770.
<br/>

<br/>
With the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, Apple has also made some changes. The maximum trade-in value of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11-pro/">iPhone 11 Pro Max</a> is up by &#36;15 to &#36;515, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/">iPhone 11</a> Pro up by &#36;5 to &#36;465, and the &zwnj;iPhone 11&zwnj; up by &#36;20 to a maximum value of &#36;380. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6S Plus value has gone up to &#36;65, versus &#36;60.
<br/>
