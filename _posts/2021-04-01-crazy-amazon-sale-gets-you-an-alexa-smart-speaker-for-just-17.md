Needless to say, that's thanks in large part to how affordable this great speaker is. The current-generation Dot retails for $50, but it goes on sale all the time. For example, right now you can get a new 4th-gen Dot for just $34.99!</p>
<p>That's a tremendous value indeed, but there's another Alexa speaker that has now stolen the title of Amazon's most affordable smart speaker. It's called the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Flex/dp/B07MLY3JKV?tag=b0c55rss-20">Echo Flex</a></strong> &mdash; and this week it's on sale for just $17.49!</p>
<h3>Today's Top Deal</h3>

<h4><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N66W9WG?tag=b0c55rss-20">Amazon shoppers are going nuts for this 22-piece screwdriver set on sale for just $22</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N66W9WG?tag=b0c55rss-20">Price: <strong>$21.99</strong></a><br><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N66W9WG?tag=b0c55rss-20">Buy Now</a></strong></p>
<p>Amazon's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Echo-Dot-4th-Gen/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>Echo Dot</strong></a> is one of the most popular hardware devices Amazon has ever made, and it's pretty clear that there are two main reasons. First, it gives users access to Amazon's beloved virtual personal assistant, Alexa. On top of that, the $50 retail price makes it so affordable. In fact, it used to be the most affordable smart speaker in Amazon's lineup until the company launched an even cheaper model that so many people still aren't aware of.</p>
<p>A new entry-level Alexa speaker was released by Amazon a while back called the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Flex/dp/B07MLY3JKV?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>Echo Flex</strong></a>. While the Echo Dot is great for Alexa and for streaming music, the Echo Flex is pretty much a dedicated Alexa device. It's very compact and doesn't take up any space on a desk or table because it's just a small box that plugs into a wall outlet. On top of that, it retails for just $25, which is half of what Amazon charges for the Dot.</p>
<p>Amazon's Dot happens to be on sale right now for $34.99, which is a great value. If you go for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Flex/dp/B07MLY3JKV?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>Echo Flex</strong></a> instead, however, and you'll only pay $17.49! There's also a separate deal that gets you an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Flex/dp/B08F9348C1?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>Echo Flex bundled with an Alexa-enabled LED smart light bulb</strong></a> for just $24.99, a savings of $10!</p>
