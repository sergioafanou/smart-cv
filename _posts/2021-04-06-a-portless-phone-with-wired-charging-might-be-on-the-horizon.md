<ul>
<li>Oppo apparently has a prototype portless and buttonless phone that supports wired charging.</li>
<li>The device is also rumored to have an under-display selfie camera and electrochromic tech to hide the rear shooter.</li>
</ul>
</div><hr>
<p>Oppo might be working on a portless, button-free phone as per the latest leak by Weibo tipster <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4622909567404571" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Chat Station</a>. However, unlike similar prototypes from <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/xiaomi-portless-concept-phone-1198563/">Xiaomi</a> and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/vivo-apex-2020-1087983/">Vivo</a> that only get a wireless charging option, Oppo&#8217;s version is also said to include wired charging.</p>
<p>The leaker claims that Oppo&#8217;s portless prototype has a USB interface hidden by &#8220;a special structural design&#8221; that is absolutely integrated with the phone. It sounds like Oppo could be experimenting with a proprietary charging technique that allows for wired charging without the need for an actual charging port. Perhaps it&#8217;s something like <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-magsafe-portless-phone-1170304/">Apple&#8217;s MagSafe technology</a> that uses magnets and an integrated charging coil to charge the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-iphone-12-1111954/">iPhones 12 lineup</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the leak also reveals that Oppo&#8217;s portless phone ditches punch holes and notches by using an under-display selfie camera. The rear camera is believed to use <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/electrochromic-glass-explained-1072644/">electrochromic tech</a> to hide its existence, possibly similar to what we saw on the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-concept-one-review-1072582/">OnePlus Concept One</a>.</p>
<p>In place of physical buttons, the Oppo phone is rumored to feature pressure-sensitive side buttons.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t know if Oppo plans to showcase this alleged portless prototype publicly like its sister brand Vivo did with its Apex line. There&#8217;s also no word on if this device will ever go into mass production. However, one thing is clear that smartphone OEMs are seriously considering a <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/portless-phones-947471/">portless future</a>. We <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/xiaomi-concept-phone-1199681/">might not be ready</a> for it just yet, but it&#8217;s definitely on the horizon.</p>
