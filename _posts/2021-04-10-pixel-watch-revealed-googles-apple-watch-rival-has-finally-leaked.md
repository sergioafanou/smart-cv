It&rsquo;s the smartwatch most people want to buy and the watch that many companies try to copy. Some have released wearables that look like Watch clones, although they&rsquo;re not quite as feature-rich as the Apple Watch. One big reason for the absence of great Apple Watch alternatives is Google, which hasn&rsquo;t made an effort to compete in this particular department in recent years. That includes both Wear OS -- the Android-based operating system that could power all those Apple Watch alternatives from other technology vendors -- and the hardware itself.</p>
<p>Previous rumors claimed that Google had abandoned its <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/09/18/pixel-watch-vs-apple-watch-5-why-theres-no-wear-os-smartwatch/">Pixel Watch project</a>, but that no longer appears to be the case. Google hasn&rsquo;t lost interest in wearables, and its acquisition of Fitbit is proof of that. On top of that, a new report from a well-known leaker gives us an early look at the Pixel Watch, which would be the first Google smartwatch launched under the Pixel brand.</p>
