<li>Vivo sub-brand Iqoo has announced the availability of its 7 series in India.</li>
<li>The Iqoo 7 Legend headlines with a BMW-inspired colorway, Snapdragon 888 SoC, and 13MP portrait shooter.</li>
<li>The series will be available to preorder from May starting at Rs 39,999.</li>

</div><hr>
<p>After it made its Chinese debut earlier this year, Vivo sub-brand Iqoo has announced its new <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/vivo-iqoo-7-1211486/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iqoo 7 series</a> in India.</p>
<p>Two devices, namely the Iqoo 7 and the Iqoo 7 Legend, do feature some aesthetic differences. The Legend is cloaked in a BMW Motorsport-inspired three-stripe livery with a more square camera array at the rear. The standard Iqoo 7 is more restrained in its colorway options and features a more rectangular camera hump around the back.</p>
<p>Despite these visual departures, the two phones share several base specifications. Both wear a 6.62-inch 120Hz AMOLED display with 2,400 x 1,080 resolution and HDR10 Plus support. The display also packs a 300Hz base touch sampling rate but can be buffed to 1,000Hz when required with Super Touch Acceleration. The two Iqoo 7 models also share 66W FlashCharge tech, a 48MP primary shooter with OIS and Pixel Shift tech, and a 13MP wide-angle camera. A 16MP selfie camera can be found in a punch hole on both devices.</p>
<p>The Iqoo 7 Legend, however, is the headlining model in terms of horsepower. It&#8217;s powered by the faster <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-snapdragon-888-phones-1182780/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snapdragon 888</a> SoC and packs a 4,000mAh battery. It also features a 13MP 50mm portrait camera as its third rear shooter. Pressure-sensitive touch buttons and linear vibration motors add to the gaming slant, too.</p>

<p>The standard Iqoo 7 sports a <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-870-vs-snapdragon-888-1193837/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snapdragon 870</a> SoC with a larger 4,400mAh battery. This might make it a better option if longevity is a key buying decision for you. Mobile photographers do have to settle for a notable switch from the 13MP portrait snapper to a 2MP mono camera, though.</p>
<h2>Iqoo 7 series: Price and availability</h2>
<p>Pricing for the Iqoo 7 starts at Rs 31,990 (~$426) for the 8GB/128GB variant and Rs 33,990 (~$453) for the 8GB/256GB model. A 12GB/256GB version is also on offer for Rs 35,990 (~$480). It will be available in Storm Black and Solid Ice Blue colorways.</p>
<p>The Iqoo 7 Legend will be available in 8GB/128GB and 12GB/256GB guises priced at Rs 39,990 (~$533) and Rs 43,990 (~$587), respectively. Unsurprisingly, it will only be available in its eponymous racing-themed colorway.</p>
<p>Both phones will be available to preorder from May 1 on Iqoo&#8217;s official site and Amazon India.</p>

                        </ul>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty competitive pricing coverage for the Legend considering its chief Snapdragon 888 rival, the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-9-1170815/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OnePlus 9</a>, starts at Rs 49,999 (~$666). The Iqoo 7 takes aim at the Snapdragon 870-powered <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-9r-review-1216576/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OnePlus 9R</a>, which comes in at Rs 39,999 (~$534).</p>
