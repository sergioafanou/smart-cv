Apple today announced the launch of its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/07/apple-announces-find-my-network-third-party-devices/">Find My network accessory program</a>, allowing compatible third-party accessories to be tracked in the ‌Find My‌ app right alongside Apple devices. The first products that work with the Find My app will  include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/07/chipolo-one-spot-item-tracker-find-my/">a new Chipolo item tracker</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/11/belkin-magsafe-charger-find-my-earbuds/">Belkin earbuds</a>, and select VanMoof e-bikes.

<br/>
While it was initially suspected that Find My's third-party accessory support might require the latest software, this is not the case after all. The updated Find My app with a new Items tab is available starting today on devices running iOS 14.3 and later, iPadOS 14.3 and later, and macOS Big Sur 11.1 or later, following a server-side change. 
<br/>

<br/>
Approved products will feature a "Works with Apple Find My" badge. When a Find My-enabled product has gone missing but is nearby, users can activate a sound on the item in an effort to pinpoint its location.

Apple is widely rumored to be working on its own item tracker called <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags</a>, and users would be able to keep track of AirTags-equipped products in the Find My app. However, given that AirTags have been rumored for nearly two years now and Apple is promoting the third-party Chipolo item tracker, it's unclear if and when AirTags will be announced.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/">iOS 14</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/">iPadOS 14</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/07/find-my-third-party-support-ios-14-3-and-later/">Find My&#039;s New Third-Party Accessory Support Works With iOS 14.3 and Later</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/find-mys-new-third-party-accessory-support-works-with-ios-14-3-and-later.2290948/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
