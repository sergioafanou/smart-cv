For this week's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/giveaway/">giveaway</a>, we've teamed up with <a href="https://fusereel.com">Fuse</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a <a href="https://fusereel.com/collections/all">full set of cable organizing options</a> for Apple devices.
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Fuse has a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/fuse-cable-organizers/">whole line</a> of cord management options for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, Apple Watch, and Mac that are well-designed and affordably priced. With so many people still working from home, Fuse accessory options are excellent for keeping home offices organized and tidy.
<br/>

<br/>
From the Side Winder that keeps the MacBook Pro's USB-C cable neatly wound to the Watch Side Winder for rolling up the Apple Watch cord and charging, Fuse has something for everyone, and we've outlined the options below.
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>Snap Backs for iPhone, iPad, and MacBook</h2>
<br/>
Available for &#36;8.99 to &#36;9.99, <a href="https://fusereel.com/collections/all">the Snap Backs</a> can be purchased for the 12W &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; charger, the 18W <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>/&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; charger, the 5W &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; charger, and the 29/30W MacBook charger.
<br/>

<br/>
Each Snap Back fits over one of Apple's chargers, and the reel at the bottom is used to wind up the cord, so you can pull out as much cord as you need with no excess. It's ideal for travel because you can roll up the entire cord to keep it organized when its tucked in a backpack or bag, and there's no extra cord to deal with when you need to pull it out to use it.
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>Side Winders for Cables of All Sizes</h2>
<br/>
Priced starting at &#36;4.99, Fuse makes small Side Winders for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; cables, headphone cables, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; cables, and more. The Side Winder is donut shaped and lets you roll the cord around the middle portion before securing the end of the cable using the included groove.
<br/>

<br/>
<a href="https://fusereel.com/collections/macbook-organizers/products/side-winder-mini-max-headphone-and-cable-winders">The Side Winder Mini</a> (&#36;4.99) is perfect for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; cables, micro-USB cables, corded headphones, and more. It can be used with cables one foot to five feet in length.
<br/>

<br/>
<a href="https://fusereel.com/products/side-winder-mini-max-headphone-and-cable-winders">The Side Winder Mini and Max</a> (&#36;7.99) are designed to work with all kinds of cables. The mini version is ideal for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; cables, micro-USB cables, and corded headphones, while the Max cable is useful for USB-C cables.
<br/>

<br/>
<a href="https://fusereel.com/collections/apple-watch-accessories-organizers/products/apple-watch-side-winder-apple-watch-charger-winder">The Side Winder Watch</a> (&#36;4.99) is designed specifically for the Apple Watch. It wraps up the Apple Watch cable and has a cutout in the center for the watch so it can be used as a charging base in addition to a cable management option.
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<h2>The Side Kick</h2>
<br/>
<a href="https://fusereel.com/collections/macbook-organizers/products/the-side-kick">The Side Kick</a>, priced at &#36;13.99, is designed to work with Apple's MacBook, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, and MacBook Pro chargers. It's a little pop out socket that attaches to the side of a MacBook power adapter using adhesive.
<br/>

<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-719248" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/11/sidekick-800x656.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="656" />
<br/>
When popped out, it can be used to wrap up a MacBook's cord neatly, allowing the power adapter and the cord to be transported with no cable mess. When you're using the cable, the Side Kick pops back in so it adds little bulk to an Apple power adapter.
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>The Side Winder</h2>
<br/>
<a href="https://fusereel.com/collections/macbook-organizers/products/the-side-kick">Priced at &#36;19.99</a>, the Side Winder is designed for the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and MacBook Pro models, and it's meant to wind up both the USB-C (or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a>) cable of a MacBook along with the extension cable.
<br/>

<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-662525" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/10/sidewindertable-800x533.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" />
<br/>
The MacBook's power adapter goes in the center and the two cables wrap up in the reel around it. You can pull out just the right amount of cable so you never have excess cable to deal with. This model is designed specifically for the power adapter with extension, and if you just have a standard USB-C cable for charging and no extension cable (USB-C Macs don't come with them by default) the Side Kick is the better option.
