<ul>
<li>Xiaomi and Oppo are reportedly getting ready to announce custom 5G chips.</li>
<li>Their respective in-house sub-6GHz 5G SoCs could launch between late 2021 and early 2022.</li>
</ul>
</div><hr>
<p>Xiaomi and Oppo seem all set to take on <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-soc-guide-908280/">Qualcomm</a> and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/mediatek-processors-879510/">MediaTek</a> by developing their own 5G smartphone SoCs.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20210408VL200.html?mod=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Digitimes</em></a>, the two Chinese vendors will introduce their respective in-house sub-6GHz 5G chips between late 2021 and early 2022.Â  Shanghai-based fabless chipmaker Unisoc will also join the two companies in developing its own smartphone processors.</p>
<p>The news comes at the back of China&#8217;s increasing investments in the semiconductor space. The country has ramped up its efforts to produce chips locally so that it doesn&#8217;t have to depend on foreign chipmakers.</p>
<p>The biggest realization came over the past two years that saw Huawei lose its ability to procure Kirin chipsets from TSMC due to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-google-android-ban-988382/">restrictions imposed by the US</a>. The country doesn&#8217;t allow component sales to Huawei if they have been manufactured using US technology. Such harsh consequences have also made other Chinese smartphone players vary of a similar fate if US-China relations were to sour further.</p>
<p>This is not the first we&#8217;ve heard of Chinese vendors entering the chip game. It was previously <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oppo-custom-processor-1084684/">reported</a> that Oppo has a so-called &#8220;Mariana Plan&#8221; to produce its own chipsets, reportedly led by a former senior Qualcomm executive. OnePlus and Realme, Oppo&#8217;s sister companies, have also apparently joined its custom chip initiative.</p>
<p>Xiaomi also recently announced its first self-developed image signal processing (ISP) chip, the Surge C1, showing that it&#8217;s very much capable of developing independent mobile chips. If the firm launches a full-fledged 5G mobile SoC sometime soon, it&#8217;ll be its second attempt at making a phone chip after the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/inside-the-xiaomi-surge-s1-784304/">Surge S1 chip</a> that released back in 2017.</p>
<p>Custom chips will also ensure that the phone makers can optimize their devices better for things like power consumption and overall performance. However, don&#8217;t expect them to ditch chips from Qualcomm and MediaTek entirely.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chinese companies aren&#8217;t the only ones working on in-house chips. Google is also <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-6-whitechapel-1214847/">rumored</a> to be making a custom smartphone silicon for the Pixel 6. You can read more about what you can expect from it <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-6-processor-1215340/">here</a>.</p>
