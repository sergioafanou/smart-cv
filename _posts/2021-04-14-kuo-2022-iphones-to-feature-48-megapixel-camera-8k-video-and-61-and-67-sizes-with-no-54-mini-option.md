The upcoming 2022 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup will feature two 6.1-inch devices and two 6.7-inch devices, with no mini-sized 5.4-inch &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, well-respected Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said in a note to investors that was seen by <em>MacRumors</em>. Two of the iPhones will be high-end models and two of the iPhones will be lower-end models, similar to the current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12</a> lineup.

Apple introduced the 5.4-inch &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; mini in the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; lineup and plans to continue to sell a 5.4-inch device in 2021, but it looks like the size will be discontinued after that, if Kuo's information is accurate. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12 mini</a> has not been selling as well as expected, according to multiple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/iphone-12-mini-sales-lackluster-cirp/">iPhone sales estimates</a>. 
<br/>

<br/>
Along with streamlining size options, Kuo believes that Apple will introduce significant camera upgrades in the 2022 iPhones, adding a 48-megapixel camera in the high-end &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 models. Kuo says that the upgraded camera lens will take &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; camera photography "to a new level."<blockquote>In terms of pixel size, the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a>, and new 2H22 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; are about 1.7um, 2um, and 1.25um, respectively. We believe that the new 2H22 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; may support direct 48MP output and 12MP (four cells merge output mode) output simultaneously. With 12MP output, the CIS pixel size of the new 2H22 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; increases to about 2.5um, which is significantly larger than the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;, and larger than existing Android phones, and close to the DSC level. We believe that the camera quality of the new 2H22 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will elevate mobile phone camera photography to a new level.</blockquote>Along with a 48-megapixel lens that will also be able to output in 12-megapixels, Kuo expects the high-end iPhones to be capable of recording 8K video, and he says that in the future, watching iPhone-recorded videos on an 8K display or TV will "offer a better user experience."
<br/>

<br/>
Because the best resolution for augmented and mixed reality is 8K to 16K, Kuo says that the 48-megapixel camera in the 2022 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will create videos and images "more suitable for AR/MR devices" and that will "enhance the AR/MR user experience."
<br/>

<br/>
As for future iPhones, Kuo says that Apple will adopt a periscope telephoto lens in 2023, along with under-display Face ID, which would presumably see the elimination of the notch. Kuo previously said that Apple would introduce a hole-punch front camera <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-some-2022-iphones-punch-hole-display/">in the 2022 iPhone</a> and that at least one &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in 2023 would feature under-display <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> and a full-screen display with no notch or holes. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/kuo-2022-iphones-no-mini-upgraded-camera/">Kuo: 2022 iPhones to Feature 48-Megapixel Camera, 8K Video, and 6.1 and 6.7&quot; Sizes With no 5.4&quot; Mini Option</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-2022-iphones-to-feature-48-megapixel-camera-8k-video-and-6-1-and-6-7-sizes-with-no-5-4-mini-option.2291619/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
