The film was made some 30 years ago in a country that rarely excelled in the film-making department, especially when it comes to competing against the powerful American movie industry. The Russian version of the film is proof of that, showing the technical limitations of the period &mdash; or the unavailability of funding that would have allowed a more expensive production.</p>
<p>Yet there&rsquo;s something magical about this particular <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> renditions. It apparently has a cult following in Russia, where fans of J.R.R. Tolkien have been frenetically searching for it for three decades. It finally was discovered, digitalized, and uploaded on YouTube, where anyone can stream it.</p>
