TVs with screens over 80 inches in size cost thousands upon thousands of dollars, but you can spend as little as a few hundred dollars on a projector and get a gigantic 100+ inch screen.</p>
<p>There is one problem people have with home theater projectors though, and anyone who has toyed with the idea of buying one likely knows what we're talking about: projector screens can add hundreds more to the cost of your home theater setup. The good news is we found a <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/120-Inch-Widescreen-Anti-Crease-Projection/dp/B07DMKZW4G?tag=b0c55rss-20">massive 120-inch projector screen</a></strong> that has thousands of 5-star ratings at Amazon, and it's on sale for just $24.98!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Carote-Stone-Derived-Non-Stick-Switzerland-Including/dp/B0732NXYNS?tag=b0c55rss-20">Price: <strong>$13.99</strong></a><br><span>You Save: $3.00 (18%)</span><br><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Carote-Stone-Derived-Non-Stick-Switzerland-Including/dp/B0732NXYNS?tag=b0c55rss-20">Buy Now</a></strong></p>
<p>If you're on the lookout for a gigantic TV, there are so many great options these days that are remarkably affordable. As a perfect example, check out this top-rated <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-X750H-65-inch-Ultra-2020/dp/B085M7NVGR?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>65-inch Sony 4K television</strong></a> that's currently under $700 at Amazon. But if you want a <em>REALLY</em> big television that's 80 inches or larger, you'll need to spend thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars to get something decent. What you might not realize, however, is that there's another option that costs a fraction as much as a supersized TV.</p>
<p>Home theater projectors from leading brands like Epson cost a small fraction of what you would pay for a huge TV, and yet many models support a nice clear image that can go up to 100 inches, 150 inches, or even larger. For example, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Epson-Projector-Brightness-Streaming-Theater/dp/B08GL2DSKZ?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>Epson HC1080 Home Cinema Projector</strong></a> supports screen sizes up to 320 inches &mdash; or almost 27 feet &mdash; and it's only $750.</p>
<p>Of course, projecting onto a wall isn't optimal, so many people get annoyed that they have to also purchase a projector screen for hundreds more. Lucky for you, we found an awesome option that costs next to nothing.</p>
<p>You should definitely check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/120-Inch-Widescreen-Anti-Crease-Projection/dp/B07DMKZW4G?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>P-JING PJ-TYB 120-Inch Projector Screen</strong></a>. It's a terrific foldable screen with a no-crease design that Amazon shoppers have been loving. You can mount it permanently on your wall or fold it and use it as a portable screen, and it has a no-crease design that eliminates the lines that bother people on most portable projector screens. Does it deliver? Well, this model has already racked up more than 6,000 5-star reviews at Amazon.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this model is very impressive. But perhaps the craziest thing about this top-rated projector screen is the price &mdash; you can pick one up on sale today at Amazon for just under $25!</p>
