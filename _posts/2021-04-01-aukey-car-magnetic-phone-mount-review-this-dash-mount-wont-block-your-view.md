<li><strong>Aukey Car Magnetic Phone Mount (HD-C49):</strong> $21.99</li>
</ul>
<p>The Aukey Car Magnetic Phone Mount is pretty much described by its name. This is a car phone holder that uses magnets to keep your handset in place while you drive. Its unconventional design makes it unique in that it offers advanced versatility. While it can be installed like any other windshield or dashboard mount, owners can also choose to keep road visibility unobstructed by bringing the arm down and have the smartphone hang under the dash.</p>
<p>Aukey&#8217;s MSRP is $21.99, but it can be often found on Amazon for lower. It costs $14.99 at the time of writing this review. It&#8217;s available in two color options: black and gray.</p>

<p>The contraption attaches to your car using a suction cup and a rubber pad with an adhesive side. The package also comes with a couple of metal plates that stick to your devices; one is larger and rectangular, while the circular one is meant to keep a lower profile. Because it&#8217;s not limited by any physical constraints, Aukey claims compatibility with &#8220;all phones and cases.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was surprised when I found out the Aukey Car Magnetic Phone Mount offers a way to attach the mount to your dashboard without obstructing the view through your windshield. This is amazing, as it makes using the mount safer and legal (double check your local laws), while taking full advantage of the ample dashboard space most of us get. This is such an ingenious solution to a very common issue. And if you don&#8217;t like this method, you can also choose to attach it to your windshield or dashboard the traditional way.</p>

<p>When it comes to design, the Aukey Car Magnetic Phone Mount isn&#8217;t exactly discrete. Its main feature is that it literally sticks out, after all. The good news is that you and your passengers won&#8217;t be totally disgusted by the view of this car phone holder. While it&#8217;s primarily made of plastic, it&#8217;s not the cheap-looking type. It&#8217;s not exactly a premium accessory, but its colors are simple, the materials aren&#8217;t cheap-feeling, and the product functions perfectly.</p>
<p>Joint movements are smooth, with just the right amount of resistance. The suction cup holds very tightly, and the bottom section even rotates for more viewing options. Furthermore, the magnetic head features a ball socket that offers even more flexibility with visibility and orientation.</p>

<p>Talking about the magnet, it was strong enough to hold a Pixel 3 XL, a Pixel 4a, and a Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus for a few hours each without random slide-offs or odd movements. The former two devices had full wallet cases on too. We&#8217;ve definitely seen stronger magnets in car phone mounts before, but this one isn&#8217;t too shabby either.</p>

<p>I must say I love the convenience this phone mount provides. Once you go magnetic, you truly can&#8217;t go back. There&#8217;s nothing like being able to slap your phone on the magnetic head or simply pulling it off whenever you jump in or out of your vehicle. The Aukey Car Magnetic Phone Mount accomplishes this beautifully.</p>
<p>And of course, we can&#8217;t forget to mention the price. For under $15 you could do so much worse than the Aukey Car Magnetic Phone Mount. This is a lot of magnetic phone holder for the money.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never been a fan of semi-permanently attaching things to my smartphones. All it means is you have to deal with forcefully pulling them off and removing old gooey adhesive residues if you don&#8217;t want to use it anymore. This one comes with a protective film, which helps a bit, but that&#8217;s still something else you have to stick on your beautiful device. You might also need to attach a pad on your dashboard, depending on the material you&#8217;re attaching the mount to. I prefer mounts I can easily hide away when not in use, but that&#8217;s just me.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the previous section, the accessory is pretty noticeable too. It won&#8217;t hide away in your car&#8217;s interior design like a vent mount would, for example. Those tend to be nice and small, but this one is definitely more &#8220;out there.&#8221;</p>

<p>There&#8217;s truly not much to complain about with the Aukey Car Magnetic Phone Mount. The couple of things I mentioned in the previous section make me seem pretty nitpicky, to be honest. With that said, this is our favorite option for those who want to use a dash/windshield mount without actually blocking your front view. The idea is seriously genius.</p>
<div class="clear"></div><blockquote class="quote_new center" style="color: #00D49F; border-color: #00D49F;"><p>The Aukey Car Magnetic Phone Mount is a lot of phone holder for the money!</p></blockquote><div class="clear"></div>
<p>Then you have the fact that it&#8217;s well designed, has all the benefits of magnetic mounting and is very affordable. You can&#8217;t really ask for much more than that. This is easily one of the best car phone holders you can buy.</p>
