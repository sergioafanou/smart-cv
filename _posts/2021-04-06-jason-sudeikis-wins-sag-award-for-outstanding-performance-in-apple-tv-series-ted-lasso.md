At the 27th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday, actor Jason Sudeikis won a SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series for his leading role as the eponymous English soccer coach in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> series "Ted Lasso."

<br/>
Sudeikis' title character is a small-time college football coach from Kansas who is hired to manage a professional soccer team in England, despite having no experience coaching soccer. The show has received positive reviews, with many viewers finding Lasso's unflappable positivity to be a welcome salve in the face of trying times.

This marks "Ted Lasso" star and executive producer Sudeikis' first Screen Actors Guild nomination and win. It comes on the heels of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/07/ted-lasso-wins-critics-choice-award/">last month's success</a> at the Critics Choice Awards, in which "Ted Lasso" won Best Comedy Series, Best Actor in a Comedy Series for Sudeikis, and Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for Hannah Waddingham, sweeping all categories in which the series was nominated. Sudeikis also won Best Actor in a Comedy Series at the Golden Globe Awards <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/28/jason-sudeikis-wins-golden-globe-award/">earlier this year</a>.

Ted Lasso has been renewed for second and third seasons, with the second season expected to premiere at some point in summer 2021.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/">Apple TV Shows</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/05/jason-sudeikis-wins-sag-award-ted-lasso/">Jason Sudeikis Wins SAG Award for Outstanding Performance in Apple TV+ Series &#039;Ted Lasso&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/jason-sudeikis-wins-sag-award-for-outstanding-performance-in-apple-tv-series-ted-lasso.2290657/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
