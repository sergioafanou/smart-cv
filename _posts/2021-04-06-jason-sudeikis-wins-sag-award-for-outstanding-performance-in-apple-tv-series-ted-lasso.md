At the 27th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday, actor Jason Sudeikis won a SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series for his leading role as the eponymous English soccer coach in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> series "Ted Lasso."

<br/>
Sudeikis' title character is a small-time college football coach from Kansas who is hired to manage a professional soccer team in England, despite having no experience coaching soccer. The show has received positive reviews, with many viewers finding Lasso's unflappable positivity to be a welcome salve in the face of trying times.

This marks "Ted Lasso" star and executive producer Sudeikis' first Screen Actors Guild nomination and win. It comes on the heels of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/07/ted-lasso-wins-critics-choice-award/">last month's success</a> at the Critics Choice Awards, in which "Ted Lasso" won Best Comedy Series, Best Actor in a Comedy Series for Sudeikis, and Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for Hannah Waddingham, sweeping all categories in which the series was nominated. Sudeikis also won Best Actor in a Comedy Series at the Golden Globe Awards <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/28/jason-sudeikis-wins-golden-globe-award/">earlier this year</a>.
