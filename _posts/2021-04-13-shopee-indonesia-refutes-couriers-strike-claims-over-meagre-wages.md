<p>Shopee Indonesia has refuted claims its Shopee Express (SPX) couriers have gone on strike to protest against underpaid wages.</p>
<p>According to Shopee Indonesia Executive Director Handhika Jahja, the company pays its couriers with a &#8220;competitive rate&#8221; in the logistics service industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted an SPX driver-partner in Greater Jakarta Area carrying 80 deliveries per day can get an incentive of IDR2,213 (US$0.15) on average for every delivery.</p>
<p>The Director also denied any delay in delivery except during its 4.4 Mega Shopping Day and that the company provides insurance for their driver-partners.</p>

<p>The allegation came from a Twitter user who stated that Shopee couriers only received IDR1,500 (US$0.10) per delivery in April 2021 from the previous fee of IDR 5,000 (US$0.34). He also stated close to a thousand couriers are on strike or resigning from the company.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the hashtag #ShopeeTindasKurir (Shopee oppresses couriers) became trending on Twitter, with netizens posting their own exchanges with the e-commerce giant&#8217;s couriers.</p>
<p>In one tweet, a courier said that he did not receive a basic salary besides the reduced delivery pay, while couriers of other companies say they receive basic salaries without incentives to cover their fuel costs.</p>
