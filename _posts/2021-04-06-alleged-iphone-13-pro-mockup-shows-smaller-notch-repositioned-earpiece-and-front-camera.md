<a href="http://www.macotakara.jp/blog/rumor/entry-41091.html">Images shared</a> by Japanese site <em>Mac Otakara</em> claim to show a 3D-printed mockup of the upcoming 6.1-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> Pro with a smaller notch, and repositioned earpiece and front camera, but with minimal changes otherwise.

<br/>
According to the images, Apple plans to move the earpiece to the top of the notch within the screen bezel, lining up with a previous <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/alleged-iphone-13-front-glass-photo/">photo shared by <em>MacRumors</em></a> that shows the same design change.
<br/>

<br/>
The alleged &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; Pro mockup, which is presumably based on leaked design drawings that frequently circulate among case manufacturers and others well ahead of Apple's official unveiling, also shows the front-facing camera moved to the left side of the notch, a change compared to its current location to the right side of the notch. Pictures of the alleged front glass panel for the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; lineup shared with <em>MacRumors</em> also show a cutout on the left side of the notch for the camera.
<br/>

<br/>
<em>Mac Otakara</em> has also shared specific dimensions of the notch for the upcoming &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; Pro, demonstrating how much the notch is expected to shrink. Compared to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/">iPhone 12 Pro</a>, the mockup suggests the 2021 Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> will feature a notch that is 5.35 mm in height vs. 5.30 mm for the &zwnj;iPhone 12 Pro&zwnj;, and 26.80 mm in width, down from 34.83 mm. Visually, the notch will be smaller in width but will be slightly taller.
<br/>

<br/>
Rumors about a smaller notch have been present since the launch of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X, which first introduced the TrueDepth system and the notch. Apple may be able to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/01/this-is-what-the-iphone-13s-notch-looks-like/">reduce the footprint of the notch</a> thanks to the relocation of the earpiece and the repositioning of the front camera. Other than the reduced notch, the images shared by <em>Macotakara </em> reveal no changes to the rear camera or other aspects of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s design.

While lacking in design changes, the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; is rumored to come with some key new features. The higher-end &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; Pro Max are rumored to come with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-pro-120hz-kuo/">ProMotion 120Hz display</a>, and the entire lineup is expected to feature a faster A15 chip, improved cameras, and new colors, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/26/iphone-13-matt-black-stainless-steel-coating/">including matte black</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macotakara-jp/">macotakara.jp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/04/iphone-13-pro-mockup-smaller-notch/">Alleged iPhone 13 Pro Mockup Shows Smaller Notch, Repositioned Earpiece and Front Camera</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/alleged-iphone-13-pro-mockup-shows-smaller-notch-repositioned-earpiece-and-front-camera.2290620/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
