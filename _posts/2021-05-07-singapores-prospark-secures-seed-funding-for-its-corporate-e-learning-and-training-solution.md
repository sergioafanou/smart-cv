<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ProSpark, a Singaporean-based edutech company that helps upskill employees in organisations, has secured an undisclosed sum in seed investment round led by AC Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other backers include 500 Startups, Azure Ventures, Assembly Ventures, Prasetia Dwidharma, and several undisclosed angels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">intends to use the funds to continue expanding its commercial footprint across Southeast Asia, boost its technology infrastructure and solidify its position in the market. </span></p>
<p>In a digitally fast-paced world, companies of different sizes can sometimes<a rel="follow" href="https://www.itagroup.com/insights/how-upskilling-your-workforce-benefits-your-organization"> find it difficult to keep up pace</a> with the changing environment. In this case, upskilling employees can create a more well-rounded and cross-trained workforce.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ProSpark is one such company that helps companies achieve this through its B2B learning management system. </span></p>

<p>Launched in 2018, the edutech startup helps employers onboard, train and certify its employees. With the use of gamified systems like leadership boards, badges, and a points system, the company also motivates its users to learn better.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of ProSpark&#8217;s prominent clients include Gojek, Bank Sampoerna, Kopi Kenangan, Northern Star Energy, PasarPolis, and RD Pawnshop. </span></p>
<p>The company has its strongest footprint in Indonesia but has recently expanded into the Philippines, one of the most digital-savvy countries in the region.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alfa Bumhira, CEO and co-founder of ProSpark, said: &#8220;Companies have been trying to find the best learning approach due to the pandemic. Now that e-learning is growing, offline learning has become relatively more costly, inefficient, and less scalable.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Their existing solutions are not flexible and expensive to maintain. ProSpark comes with a solution that is personalised and measurable: learning that is adaptive with perceptible outcomes. The funding should help us expand the end-to-end user experience by providing expanded content solutions, better competencies’ gaps mapping capabilities, and strengthen our focus on user learning outcomes,&#8221; he added. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;The offline workforce is at risk of being left behind in the new digital economy and this problem has been accelerated by the global pandemic. Training this workforce on the skills they need to survive and thrive is of great necessity. We believe ProSpark&#8217;s e-learning solution can scale across the SEA region and address this upskilling problem in various sectors,&#8221; added Binh Tran, General Partner at 500 Startups.</p>
