Technicians in China have reportedly succeeded in upgrading the memory and storage of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip, suggesting that Apple's integrated custom silicon for the Mac may be more flexible than previously thought.

<br/>
Reports of maintenance technicians being able to expand the memory and storage of &zwnj;M1&zwnj; Macs began circulating <a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1378721039086067714?s=21">on Chinese social media</a> over the weekend, but now <a href="https://www.chongdiantou.com/wp/archives/73084.html">international reports</a> have started to clarify the situation.
<br/>

<br/>
Technicians in Guangzhou, China have discovered that it is possible to detach the RAM from the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chip and its nearby SSD module and replace them with larger capacity components, which are correctly recognized by macOS, without breaking the device.

<br/>
As proof, a large number of images showing the process of a base model &zwnj;M1&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage being upgraded to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, and this change being correctly shown in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/">macOS Big Sur</a>, have been shared online.
<br/>

<br/>
The RAM and SSD components on Apple's &zwnj;M1&zwnj; Macs are soldered in place, making the procedure extremely challenging, and there is reportedly a high chance of failure. This invasive unofficial upgrade also undoubtedly breaches Apple's warranty.

<br/>
Apple has made it increasingly challenging for users to upgrade their own Macs over the years, and it was thought that the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; Mac represented a final solidification of this move, with all of the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; Mac's computing components being heavily physically integrated. The possibility of upgrading the memory and storage of &zwnj;M1&zwnj; Macs, albeit in an invasive and risky procedure, therefore seems to be a significant discovery.

<br/>
Due to the difficulty of upgrading the RAM or SSD, almost all &zwnj;M1&zwnj; owners will likely still have to rely on the memory and storage configuration that they chose at the point of purchase, with upgrades being confined to a minority of enthusiasts, although it has been suggested that &zwnj;M1&zwnj; Mac memory and storage upgrades in Asia will be available through unofficial channels.

&zwnj;M1&zwnj; Mac owners may be keen to see if the process behind these upgrades is refined over time and becomes a more viable option.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/">MacBook Pro 13"</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13">13" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/06/m1-mac-ram-and-ssd-upgrades-possible/">M1 Mac RAM and SSD Upgrades Found to Be Possible After Purchase</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m1-mac-ram-and-ssd-upgrades-found-to-be-possible-after-purchase.2290783/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
