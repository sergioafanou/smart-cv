In fact, even now that it has been replaced by the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3/dp/B0849J7W5X?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>Ring Video Doorbell 3</strong></a> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B08JNR77QY?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>Ring Video Doorbell 4</strong></a> that both cost even less, it's still worth every penny of that original retail price that so many people paid. Crystal-clear 1080 Full HD resolution, a head-to-toe view from the ultra-wide-angle lens, and Amazon Alexa integration are just a few of the awesome features that make this model so great. Ring's second-generation Video Doorbell also provides peace of mind on top of all those great convenience features.</p>
<p>If you're in the market for an excellent video doorbell but you don't want to pay top dollar, we've got terrific news. Hurry and you can pick up a used model on Amazon right now for just $69.99, which is the lowest price we've ever seen for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Used-Acceptable-Condition-Activated-Installation/dp/B08PCRN5YT?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>Ring Video Doorbell 2</strong></a> by a very wide margin.</p>

<p>The newer <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3/dp/B0849J7W5X?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>Ring Video Doorbell 3</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B08JNR77QY?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>Ring Video Doorbell 4</strong></a> add a few nifty features compared to the previous-generation model. Examples include improved motion detection, privacy zones, and compatibility with 5.0 GHz Wi-Fi networks. Those features are indeed nice additions, but are they worth an extra $110? That's the question you should ask yourself before you buy the third-gen model because it sells for $179.99 at Amazon and other retailers. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Used-Acceptable-Condition-Activated-Installation/dp/B08PCRN5YT?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>Ring Video Doorbell 2</strong></a>, on the other hand, can be had for just $69.99 right now if you hurry over to Amazon and pick up a used model before they all sell out.</p>
<p>Only $70... that's crazy!</p>
<p>Used products sold by Amazon might have a few cosmetic issues here and there, but you won't find any serious issues. If you do, you can always return your purchase for a full refund. Amazon calls this "used-acceptable condition," and you can save a fortune if you take advantage of the program. In the case of the Ring Video Doorbell 2, it's one of only four Amazon device deals that are currently featured on Amazon's site, so there's a very good chance it's going to sell out soon.</p>
