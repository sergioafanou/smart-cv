Once the maker of Google Nexus phones, and the maker of flagships that rivaled the likes of the Galaxy S models, LG has lost its way. Even back when LG looked like it was in a position to compete against Apple and Samsung, the South Korean giant&rsquo;s mobile division was bleeding money.</p>
<p>LG has been losing money since 2015, so recent rumors that LG was considering exiting the smartphone business, or selling its mobile arm, did not surprise people familiar with the company's failures. The latest report on the matter says that LG has made up its mind and that it will soon announce plans to abandon the mobile business.</p>
