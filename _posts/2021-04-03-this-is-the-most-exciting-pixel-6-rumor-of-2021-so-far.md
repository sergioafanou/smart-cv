It features decent specs, an improved design over the disappointing Pixel 4, and an ever-reliable camera, all for a great price in a year hit by massive health and economic crises. But that didn&rsquo;t change the fact that the Pixel 5 was also a massive disappointment for many people who wanted a variant of the phone that could at least compete against the iPhone 11 when it comes to performance, if not the iPhone 12. <a href="https://bgr.com/2020/10/23/iphone-12-pro-speed-test-vs-note-20-ultra-vs-pixel-5/">The Pixel 5 wasn&rsquo;t that</a>.</p>
<p>But reports last year also gave Pixel fans reasons for hope. Google supposedly chose the Snapdragon 765 platform for the Pixel 5 to cut costs, but the company was already developing its own custom processor. Google would, thus, follow in Apple and Samsung&rsquo;s footsteps. Google partnered with Samsung to manufacture its processors, which are codenamed Whitechapel, according to <a href="https://bgr.com/2020/04/14/pixel-5-specs-disappoint-but-pixel-6-will-get-custom-google-chip/">a report from April 2020</a> that claimed the custom chip would be ready in time for 2021 products. This report prompted speculation that the Pixel 6 would feature Google&rsquo;s own silicon, and we now have the first rumor that indicates the Pixel 6 will have a processor made by Google.</p>
