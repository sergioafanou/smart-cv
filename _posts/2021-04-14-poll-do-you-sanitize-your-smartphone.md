<p>The past year has taught us how important personal hygiene really is. As the pandemic continues across the globe, seemingly innocuous actions like washing your hands remain essential. But what about the objects we come into contact with regularly, like our smartphones?</p>
<p>Some readers likely sanitize their smartphones daily, even before the pandemic. They may use a cleaning wipe or solution. Others may own a <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-uv-sterilizer-1135559/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UV case</a> that purports to kill bacteria and other harmful organisms using ultraviolet light. Others possibly believe that the need to also <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-clean-android-smartphones-tablets-643451/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sanitize their smartphone</a> is a bridge too far. After all, if your hands are always clean, isn&#8217;t your smartphone always clean too?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re just asking the questions, though. Whatever your views, we want to hear from you. Do you sanitize your phone? If so, how do you do it? If not, why not?</p>
