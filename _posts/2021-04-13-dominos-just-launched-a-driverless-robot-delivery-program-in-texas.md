On Monday, <a href="https://dominos.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dominosr-and-nuro-launch-autonomous-pizza-delivery-road-robot">Domino's announced</a> that it has partnered with self-driving delivery company Nuro to bring autonomous pizza deliveries to Houston, Texas as part of a pilot program.</p>
<p>As Domino's explains in a press release, select customers who place a prepaid order on Dominos.com on specific days and times from the Domino's in the Woodland Heights neighborhood (3209 Houston Ave.) can choose to have their pizza delivered by one of Nuro's R2 robots, which is the first autonomous, driverless on-road delivery vehicle to receive regulatory approval from the US Department of Transportation.</p>
