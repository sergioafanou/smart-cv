<a href="https://www.gazelle.com">Gazelle</a>, a company that buys old iPhones, iPads, and Macs, has reinstated its device trade-in program after initially ending it in February.

<br/>
Back in December, Gazelle announced plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/31/gazelle-used-device-trade-in-ending/">end its trade-in program</a> in 2021, and said that it would shut down trade-in options on February 1, 2021. Gazelle stopped taking trade-ins at that time, but has since reversed course on the decision.
<br/>

<br/>
As of April 5, Gazelle is once again accepting online trade-ins for smartphones and tablets. In an email to customers that was also shared with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370595/gazelle-trade-in-program-is-back-returns-iphone-samsung-smartphone-selling">The Verge</a></em>, Gazelle said that trade-ins were reinstated after feedback from consumers.<blockquote>Earlier this year, we announced that we will no longer be offering our trade-in option on Gazelle. After careful consideration, including feedback from customers like you, we have decided to keep Gazelle Trade-In going. Today, we are happy to say, 'We're back, baby!' Gazelle Trade-In is a pioneer of the electronics trade-in space and we are happy to continue building on our legacy by offering a simple process and immediate payouts for those unwanted devices.</blockquote>When initially announcing that its online trade-in program was ending, Gazelle said that it would instead focus on its in-store ecoATM kiosks, which are designed to offer instant cash for devices.

Gazelle operates more than 4,000 ecoATM units across the United States and has collected more than 25 million devices.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/06/gazelle-resumes-trade-in-program/">Gazelle Decides Not to End Device Trade-In Program After All</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gazelle-decides-not-to-end-device-trade-in-program-after-all.2290843/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
