<p>Many of these episodes garner headlines simply because of the scale of the data breach and the target of the attack. Facebook is one example of this, as the social network is still facing an onslaught of criticism online over the revelation from this past weekend that the company has suffered yet another embarrassingly massive data leak -- encompassing personal information from more than <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/533-million-facebook-users-phone-numbers-and-personal-data-reported-leaked-online-11617475820">533 million Facebook users</a> across 106 countries. Meantime, hackers themselves are also getting hacked, as word of a separate breach at a hub for stolen data has also just been reported.</p>
