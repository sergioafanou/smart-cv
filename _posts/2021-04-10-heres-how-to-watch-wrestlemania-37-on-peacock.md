<p>Pro wrestling is finally starting to come out of its Covid-19 slumber and is slowly coming back to the four corner mat. This weekend, World Wrestling Entertainment, better known as WWE, is holding its biggest event of the year: Wrestlemania 37.</p>
<p>In many ways, this is a turning point for the WWE, which had to make tons of changes after the Covid-19 pandemic began in March 2020. The organization stopped holding live matches in cities around the world, and instead started taping TV shows and PPV events in fixed locations in Florida, without an audience in the seats. That may finally begin to change, at least a little, for Wrestlemania 37.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s expected to be shown at the biggest PPV event of the year? Here&#8217;s everything you need to know about Wrestlemania 37. If you live in the US, you can go ahead and sign up for the Peacock Premium streaming service below so you can be ready to watch the show ahead of time.</p>

<h2>What is Wrestlemania 37?</h2>
<p>This is the annual multi-match event that is usually the biggest on the calendar for the WWE organization. It has the biggest matches of the year and generally concludes a number of storylines from the WWE&#8217;s TV shows Raw and Smackdown, while also launching new storylines.</p>
<div id="whenandwhereisit" class="content-section-divider" data-label="When and where is it?"></span></div>
<h2>When is Wrestlemania 37?</h2>
<p>The event is being held over two nights: Saturday, April 10, and Sunday, April 11. The show begins at 8 p.m. Eastern time on both nights. Unlike last year&#8217;s Wrestlemania 36, which was taped before it was shown, this year&#8217;s event will be streamed live.</p>
<h2>Where is the event being held this year?</h2>
<p>WWE will hold the event at the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. For the first time since the Covid-19 lockdowns began in March 2020, the WWE is allowing fans to buy tickets to watch Wrestlemania 37 in the stands. About 25,000 fans will attend, and all will have to obey strict Covid-19 rules, including the wearing of masks and temperature checks.</p>
