Unfortunately, there will be one major casualty in the wake of 5G as virtually every major carrier in the US prepares to phase out support for 3G. AT&amp;T will seemingly be the first carrier to follow through with its plan -- <a href="https://www.att.com/support/article/wireless/KM1324171/">the company's support site</a> says the 3G network will be gone by February 2022.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T goes on to explain that talk and data services won't work on phones, tablets, and smartwatches that don't support at least 4G LTE and HD Voice. Thankfully, AT&amp;T has published <a href="https://www.att.com/idpassets/images/support/wireless/Devices-Working-on-ATT-Network.pdf">a comprehensive list</a> of every phone that will still be compatible with its network after next February. You can click on that link to see the PDF, but we've also shared every phone on the list below.</p>
