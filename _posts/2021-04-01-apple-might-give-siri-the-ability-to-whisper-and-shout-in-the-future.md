We have seen all sorts of new features and use cases for the software over the last decade, but there is still plenty Siri can't do. For example, if you want to hear Siri's responses in a loud office or airport or stadium, your best bet is to turn the volume up and hold your phone really close to your ear. According to a recent patent application <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/04/01/future-siri-may-adjust-speech-based-on-environmental-conditions-user-input">spotted by <em>AppleInsider</em></a>, the company is looking into giving Siri environmental awareness that will affect the way it speaks.</p>
<p>As <em>AppleInsider</em> notes, Alexa and other virtual assistants are capable of responding in a "whisper" in situations when a loud response might not be appropriate. Siri currently lacks this functionality, but the patent application makes it clear that Apple is at least researching technology that would allow Siri to alter its response based on a number of factors, from the background noise level to the layout of a room to the volume of the user's command.</p>
