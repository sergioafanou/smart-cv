Apple is facing a global shortage of certain components for some of its MacBook and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> models, causing the Cupertino tech giant and its suppliers to postpone production of the products, according to a <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/MacBook-and-iPad-production-delayed-as-supply-crunch-hits-Apple">new report</a> from <em>Nikkei Asia</em>.

<br/>
According to the report, MacBook production is being hindered due to the shortage of chips mounted onto the circuit board before final assembly, which is a key step in the overall production process. &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; production is being impacted due to display and display component shortages, the report adds.
<br/>

<br/>
In response to the pushed back production, Apple has postponed component orders for the two devices to the second half of the year. While MacBook and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; production is being directly impacted, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> production is so far not affected. However, industry sources say that supplies for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; components are limited.
<br/>
<blockquote>Production plans for Apple's iconic iPhones have so far not been affected by the supply shortage, although the supply of some components for the devices is "quite tight," according to two sources. Overall, the component shortage remains a supply chain issue for Apple and has not yet had an impact on product availability for consumers, Nikkei has learned. </blockquote>Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/apple-event-april-rumor-recap/">widely expected</a> to be launching new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models and possibly redesigned MacBook Pros with Apple silicon in the coming months. <em>Bloomberg</em> has reported that new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/kuo-12-9-inch-mini-led-ipad-pro-production/">drastically improved performance and a new mini-LED display</a> are simply weeks away from launch. 
<br/>

<br/>
While <em>Nikkei</em> doesn't specify which &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and MacBook models are being impacted due to the shortage, it certainly seems plausible that the delayed assembly of the products could result in some form of a delayed product announcement from Apple.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini 5</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/">MacBook Pro 13"</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 16"</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nikkei-com/">nikkei.com</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad">iPad (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13">13" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">16" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/ipad-macbook-production-postponed-nikkei/">iPad and MacBook Production Reportedly Delayed Due to Global Chip Shortage</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-and-macbook-production-reportedly-delayed-due-to-global-chip-shortage.2291022/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
