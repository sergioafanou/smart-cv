This has sparked major controversies in recent years, perhaps most notably when <a href="https://bgr.com/tech/san-bernardino-iphone-hack-how-azimuth-broke-encryption-5919480/">Apple refused to unlock the phone of the San Bernardino shooter</a>, but as Apple noted at the time, creating a backdoor into iOS would put every user at risk. It's a complex issue without any simple solutions.</p>
<p>Matt Bergin, a senior researcher at security firm KoreLogic, decided that the best way to shed light on the issues that arise when cops start snooping through our phones was to make an app that is capable of countering digital forensics software like Cellebrite by factory resetting a phone as soon as the software is detected.</p>
