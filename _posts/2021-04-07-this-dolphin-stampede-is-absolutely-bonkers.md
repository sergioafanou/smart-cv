For a group of whale watchers that recently took a trip with Dana Wharf Whale Watching, they got what can only be described as a once-in-a-lifetime treat, and we don't even know if they got to see any whales. The boat and its passengers were lucky enough to stumble upon a "mega pod" of dolphins that were cruising through the water and it's a sight unlike any you've ever seen.</p>
<p>In a new YouTube video, we're able to enjoy a few brief moments of the "dolphin stampede," as the company calls it, and it's really something. We don't know the exact number but it's estimated that there were up to a thousand aquatic mammals in this group, all swimming and jumping in the same direction in one massive mob.</p>
