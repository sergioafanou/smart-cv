<p>According to recent market research <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS47601721">from IDC</a>, overall PC shipments during the first quarter of 2021 were up 55% year over year. This data point is likely attributable to the fact that more people than ever before are working remotely due to COVID-19 and are investing in home workstations.</p>
