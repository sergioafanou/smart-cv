It feels like one long Marvel movie, which is what many fans seem to want. That&rsquo;s not to say that <em>WandaVision</em> isn&rsquo;t a fun show to watch or that Marvel doesn&rsquo;t deserve recognition for trying a new approach in telling superhero stories, but <em>Falcon</em> manages to hit all the right notes while telling a more familiar story.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t just get to explore Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) more thoroughly than we could have in a traditional <em>Captain America</em> or <em>Avengers</em> film. We also discover exciting antagonists that could show up time and again in upcoming MCU Phase 4 adventures. <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/04/07/falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-zemo-cut-viral-dance/">Zemo (Daniel Br&uuml;hl)</a> and <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/04/09/falcon-winter-soldier-episode-4-review-john-walker-captain-america-amazing/">John Walker (Wyatt Russell)</a> are at the top of the list of not-quite-villains who we&rsquo;ll want to see in future films and TV series. Not to mention that we get to explore this broken world of the future, where people are still trying to deal with the massive blip that brought everyone back after five years. That&rsquo;s a side of the MCU&rsquo;s Earth we were never shown until now, and <em>WandaVision</em> only scratched the surface.</p>
<p>With two episodes to go, Marvel is now teasing the<em>&nbsp;Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> fight scene we&rsquo;ve all been waiting for since it began. And it has nothing to do with <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/04/10/falcon-winter-soldier-episode-5-mysterious-cameo/">the surprise cameo in Episode 5</a> that we&rsquo;ve been told to expect. Before you go any further, <strong>significant spoilers</strong> for the first four episodes follow below.</p>
