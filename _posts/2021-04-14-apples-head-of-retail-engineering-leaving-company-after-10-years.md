<br/>
Rau <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6787723004332900352/">announced his departure from Apple</a> on Linkedin, saying that it has been a privilege to work with his colleagues at Apple and that the company has "set the standard for the retail industry." 
<br/>

<br/>
Rau joined Apple in April of 2011, and during his tenure, he witnessed and helped the company expand its retail locations and presence around the world. Throughout the years, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-retail-stores/">Apple Stores</a> have taken on a life of their own, serving as a community hub rather than simply a place to purchase products. 
<br/>

<br/>
Rau also spearheaded Apple's efforts in the digital space, helping to grow its e-commerce platforms, the Apple Store app, and the roll-out of product launches at retail locations. Rau will begin his new role at Lilly on May 17.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-retail-stores/">Apple Stores</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/13/apple-head-of-retail-engineering-leaving/">Apple&#039;s Head of Retail Engineering Leaving Company After 10 Years</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-head-of-retail-engineering-leaving-company-after-10-years.2291547/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
