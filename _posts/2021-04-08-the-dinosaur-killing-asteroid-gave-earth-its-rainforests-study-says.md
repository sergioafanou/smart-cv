We've all seen documentaries and fictional portrayals of dinosaurs in such settings, but new research suggests that the rainforests were a whole lot different when the dinosaurs ruled the land, and we have the dinosaur-killing asteroid to thank for the tropical rainforests we see today.</p>
<p>As <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/04/prior-to-the-chicxulub-impact-rainforests-looked-very-different/">Ars Technica</a></em> reports, a new paper published in <em><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6537/63">Science</a> </em>provides us with a picture of what the thick forests in places like Colombia were like before and after the arrival of the colossal asteroid that slammed into present-day Mexico. The dramatic climate shift that the impact triggered completely changed the makeup of plant life across the globe, but rainforests may have seen the biggest changes of all.</p>
