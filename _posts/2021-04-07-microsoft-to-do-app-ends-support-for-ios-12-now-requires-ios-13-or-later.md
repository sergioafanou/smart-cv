In its latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> update, Microsoft To Do has ended support for iOS 12 and older, officially requiring that all users must be running iOS 13 or later in order to receive app updates.

Microsoft To Do rose to popularity last year following the closure of Wunderlist and Microsoft's acquisition of the company. Since then, Microsoft To Do has been playing catch-up in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/09/10/microsoft-to-do-app-lures-wunderlist-fans/">attempting to keep former Wunderlist users</a> hocked onto its service.
<br/>

<br/>
With a previous &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; update, Microsoft added <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/">iOS 14</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">widgets</a> to its "intelligence task management app," giving users quick access to their tasks on their homescreen. Last week, Microsoft <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-shuts-down-cortana-app-ios-android/">shut down Cortona for iOS and Android</a>, and tasks previously stored with Cortona were automatically added to Microsoft To Do.

Microsoft To Do is available on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.
