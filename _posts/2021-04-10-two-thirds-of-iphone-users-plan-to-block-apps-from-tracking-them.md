The new release should add several new features, including the highly-anticipated App Tracking Transparency (ATT) privacy feature that will force all app developers to ask for permission before tracking users online.</p>
<p>The move sparked a protest from Facebook, one of the companies that makes most of its money from online ads. The ability to track users is essential for serving personalized ads and monitoring the performance of those campaigns. Facebook has claimed that Apple&rsquo;s new privacy features will hurt the free web and small businesses, launching its own ad campaign <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/02/02/facebook-user-tracking-prompt-iphone-ipad-ios-14-privacy/">asking users to continue to allow it to track them</a> once iOS 14.5 rolls out.</p>
<p>Apple has repeatedly explained that the new privacy features will not block developers from tracking users. But ATT forces apps to ask for permission and to explain the purpose of that data collection. A new survey indicates that more than two-thirds of iPhone users will block ad tracking once apps start asking.</p>
