<li>Samsung will launch two foldable phones later this year, according to a report from Korea.</li>
<li>The Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 2 are expected to debut in July.</li>
</ul>
</div><hr>
<p>Smartphone makers&#8217; plans may have been affected by the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/computer-chip-shortage-1212941/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global chipset shortage</a>, but Samsung is apparently pushing on with its foldable phone launches this year. According to a report by <a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Elec</em></a>, the company is set to launch the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 2 as early as July.</p>
<p>We can also expect design changes to the display and battery of the larger foldable. The report quotes a drop in battery capacity to 4,380mAh — the same capacity as the original <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-977100/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galaxy Fold</a>. As for the display, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 might see less real estate than its predecessor. The folding screen reportedly measures 7.5 inches, while the outer screen comes in at 6.2 inches. A refresh rate bump could be on the cards, though.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Z Flip 2 may also gain a smaller battery, according to an <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-2-battery-1215072/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier report</a>. The foldable may see a drop from a 3,300mAh dual-cell design to 3,200mAh.</p>
<h2>Galaxy Z Fold 3: This year&#8217;s Note replacement?</h2>
<p>Samsung did confirm in December that it plans to slim down its foldable phone lines, making them more pocketable. The Galaxy Z Fold 3 may sport <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-s-pen-1202864/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S Pen functionality</a> too, which should further improve its versatility.</p>

                        </ul>
<p>Should Samsung launch its foldable devices in July, it would largely make up for the lack of a Note device this year. The Note series traditionally debuts in August. In March, the company confirmed that there would be no <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-note-2022-1209176/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galaxy Note 21</a> series this year but didn&#8217;t completely rule out the series&#8217; death entirely.</p>
<p>Still, with rumors of a slimmer build, S Pen support, and now a Q2 launch date, it seems that Samsung might be billing the Galaxy Z Fold 3 as this year&#8217;s — and possibly future — Note replacement.</p>
