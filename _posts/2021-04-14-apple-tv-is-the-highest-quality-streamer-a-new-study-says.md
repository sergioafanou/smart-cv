Over the weekend, for example, I checked out the debut episode of <a href="https://www.hbo.com/the-nevers"><em>The Nevers</em></a>, a fun new <a href="https://www.hbomax.com/">HBO Max</a> original series set in Victorian London. In it, a group of mostly women are &ldquo;touched&rdquo; with extraordinary powers and abilities -- one of whom, played by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/laurafdonnelly/">Laura Donnelly</a>, is an absolute beast in hand-to-hand combat, even while wearing a restrictive period dress -- and viewers apparently agreed with me. The show delivered the <a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/nevers-premiere-ratings-best-debut-hbo-max-1234949753/">biggest debut audience</a> ever for the inaugural episode of an HBO Max original series.</p>
<p>From there, we could talk about the other major streamers that have blockbuster content on the way, like Netflix -- which just renewed its smash-hit <a href="https://twitter.com/bridgerton/status/1381952803128676355"><em>Bridgerton</em> for a third and fourth season</a>. Also, Netflix is dropping a new season this summer of <a href="https://twitter.com/lupinnetflix?lang=en"><em>Lupin</em></a>, its French-language original series about a gentleman thief that quickly became one of the streamer&rsquo;s biggest shows of all time. And Disney+ has some massive series teed up for release, like <a href="https://bgr.com/entertainment/loki-trailer-disney-plus-tom-hiddleston-owen-wilson-5917975/">Season 1 of <em>Loki</em> coming this summer</a>. Having pointed to all these, though, we should note that for some people it's still too easy to overlook one of the relatively newer streaming players: <a href="https://bgr.com/entertainment/apple-tv-plus-shows-launched-in-2020-tehran-ted-lasso-5897527/">Apple TV+</a>. And here is why you absolutely shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
