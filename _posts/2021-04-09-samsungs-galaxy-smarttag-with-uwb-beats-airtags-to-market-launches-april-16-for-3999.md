<br/>
In January, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/14/samsungs-30-smarttags-beat-airtags-to-launch/">Samsung announced the "Galaxy SmartTag,"</a> a small squircle-shaped device that can be used to track and locate items such as keys, bags, and more. Samsung announced two versions of the SmartTag, one that uses Bluetooth LE 5.0 technology and the SmartTag Plus variant that utilizes UWB technology.
<br/>

<br/>
UWB, or ultra-wideband technology, offers more precise, short-range location tracking compared to typical Bluetooth. The technology has grown in adoption in recent years as the market for supported UWB accessories is expected to grow.
<br/>

<br/>
Yesterday, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/07/apple-announces-find-my-network-third-party-devices/">Apple opened up its Find My network</a> for accessories makers to take advantage of UWB in Apple devices. Under the network, accessory makers will tap into the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a> ecosystem, allowing customers to track their items on their iPhones, iPads, and Macs.
<br/>

<br/>
Even though the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network is tailored for UWB accessories, the Galaxy SmartTag Plus uses
<br/>
Samsung's own "Galaxy Find Network" and will not be compatible with Apple devices. 
<br/>

<br/>
Notably, while the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network is open to third-party accessory makers who manufacture UWB trackers, Apple has yet to release its own. For the past nearly two years, rumors have swirled about the launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags</a>, circular devices that would offer UWB item-tracking. Apple has yet to announce the tracker, but it is committed to opening up the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; networks to others.
<br/>

<br/>
One aspect of the &zwnj;AirTags&zwnj; experience is rumored to be the ability for users to use AR inside the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app to get directions to their item. Samsung's Galaxy SmartTag Plus now offers that same experience, allowing customers to use a viewfinder in their UWB-enabled Galaxy smartphones to get led to the location of their SmartTag, and hence, whatever item it is attached to.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-plus-uwb/">Samsung&#039;s Galaxy SmartTag With UWB Beats AirTags to Market, Launches April 16 for &#36;39.99</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsungs-galaxy-smarttag-with-uwb-beats-airtags-to-market-launches-april-16-for-39-99.2291051/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
