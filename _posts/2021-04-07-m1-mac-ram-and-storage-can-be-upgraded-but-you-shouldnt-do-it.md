The devices received rave reviews, especially the laptops, praised for their performance and long battery life. Maybe the best judgment of the M1 MacBooks comes from Intel, which mounted a massive anti-M1 campaign, criticizing all the faults of Apple&rsquo;s M1-powered hardware. Intel&rsquo;s stunt backfired, with the chipmaker receiving plenty of criticism for the way it chose to compare Intel laptops to M1 MacBooks.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing to criticize about the M1 Macs, it&rsquo;s that they&rsquo;re hard to upgrade. That&rsquo;s not news for anyone buying MacBooks, as they come with RAM and SSDs that are soldered to the logic board, making user upgrades impossible. But the same goes for the M1 Mac mini, which has a logic board with soldered memory and storage. It turns out there is a way to upgrade the RAM and storage of the M1 Macs, but you absolutely should not do it.</p>
