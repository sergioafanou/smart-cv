While fingerprints aren't exactly a huge issue, it can sometimes be something of a letdown when you spend upwards of a grand on a new iPhone only to see it littered with smudges a few days later.</p>
<p>Now before you get too excited, Weinbach adds that the special coating in question will be exclusive to Apple's iPhone 13 Pro models. All in all, this isn't too surprising given that Apple historically reserves some of its newer materials and technologies for its higher-margined devices. In a similar vein, the rumored 120Hz ProMotion display coming to the iPhone 13 will also be exclusive to the Pro models.</p>
