JAPAN, and LINE have become one,&#8221; Shinichiro Hori, CEO of ZVC, said. &#8220;By providing growth capital to startup companies and access to ZHD&#8217;s ecosystem, we look forward to working together with companies to evolve our services and make tomorrow’s society better.&#8221;</p>
<p>For global investments, ZVC will adopt a sector-agnostic approach but with a strategic focus on sectors like consumer internet, e-commerce, fintech, and O2O mobility.</p>
