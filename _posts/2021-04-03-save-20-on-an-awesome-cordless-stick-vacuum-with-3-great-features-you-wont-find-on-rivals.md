The problem for that top vacuum brand that we don't even have to name for you to know who we're talking about, is that vacuums from "everyone else" have gotten so good in recent years, there's no longer much reason to spend $400, $500, or even close to $1,000 on a vacuum from that other company.</p>
<p>A perfect example is the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultenic-U11-Lightweight-Removable-Filtration/dp/B08M6LCLLP?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>Ultenic U11 Cordless Vacuum Cleaner</strong></a>, which costs a small fraction of what you'd pay for a comparable model from the market leader. And not only is it just as good, it actually has three very cool features that you won't find on similar models from the pricey British vacuum maker everyone knows so well.</p>

<p>The first thing you should know about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultenic-U11-Lightweight-Removable-Filtration/dp/B08M6LCLLP?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>Ultenic U11 Cordless Vacuum Cleaner</strong></a> is that despite its comparatively low price tag, it has all the basic features you could find on much more expensive models. It has strong 25,000Pa suction, a HEPA filter, all the different attachments you might need, and great battery life that lasts almost an hour per charge. Think about how long you actually use your cordless stick vacuum each time you take it out. 3 minutes? 5-7 minutes at most? You'll never have to worry about this great vacuum dying on you.</p>
<p>Beyond all the basics, there are also three standout features that you won't find on Ultenic's British rival.</p>
<p>First, there's a nice bright LED built into the brush head so you can see all the dust and dirt you need to clean. Only one brand new model from the British vacuum maker has built-in lighting and it costs a whopping $700! Next, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultenic-U11-Lightweight-Removable-Filtration/dp/B08M6LCLLP?tag=b0c55rss-20"><strong>Ultenic U11</strong></a> comes with a great stand that charges the vacuum and has spots to store the attachments. That's the kind of accessory you typically need to buy separately. And finally, there's an awesome grooming brush attachment for the Ultenic U11 that lets you suck up all that excess pet hair without bothering your pup.</p>
<p>This cordless vacuum is terrific, and it retails for just $219. Head over to Amazon right now, however, and you'll find it on sale for $175.20 thanks to a 20% coupon you can clip!</p>
