<li>Oppo updates will now come for three years for the just-launched Oppo Find X3 series.</li>
<li>This is one year longer than Oppo previously promised. However, do note that this only applies to security updates, not Android upgrades.</li>
<li>This doesn&#8217;t quite match Samsung&#8217;s update promise, but it&#8217;s certainly a step in the right direction.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the world of Android, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-samsung-phones-771831/">Samsung</a> is now the gold standard when it comes to Android updates. For almost all of its phones, the company offers <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-android-updates-opinion-1149708/">three Android versions</a>. During the fourth year, the company will continue to supply security updates on a quarterly basis. After that, the phone officially loses all support.</p>
<p>It looks like certain Oppo updates could move closer to this standard set by Samsung. According to <a href="https://www.androidplanet.nl/nieuws/oppo-find-x3-verbetering-updatebeleid/"><em>Android Planet</em></a>, Oppo&#8217;s Find X3 series will now get three years of software support. This isn&#8217;t quite as good as Samsung&#8217;s promise, as the phones would only see two Android upgrades during that three-year span. However, it&#8217;s certainly a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>For clarity, the Find X3 series currently includes the Find X3 Neo, Find X3 Lite, and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oppo-find-x3-pro-review-1206375/">Find X3 Pro</a>. The vanilla Find X3 is currently only available in China, but it would obviously see the same update schedule as the rest.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, other Oppo phones — including last year&#8217;s flagship, the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oppo-find-x2-pro-review-1092058/">Oppo Find X2 Pro</a> — will only see the usual two years of updates.</p>
<p>According to <em>Android Planet</em>, Oppo hopes updates will come for even longer for the Find X3 series. However, the company is still experimenting with its systems to determine if four years of updates — and, theoretically, three Android upgrades — is feasible.</p>
