Apple yesterday updated its <a href="https://artists.apple.com">Apple Music for Artists</a> app with some minor bug fixes and improvements, but also one other notable change -- a new icon.
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> for Artists app now features a simpler, streamlined icon with a pinkish red music logo rather than the multicolored logo that was used before. The icon also has an embossed look that makes it stand out from other Apple icons.
<br/>

<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; for Artists is an app that lets artists know how their music is performing across &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, iTunes, and Shazam, so it's an app with a limited audience and the new icon may seem inconsequential, but it is similar to another app icon change that Apple introduced last year.
<br/>

<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> Connect in October <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/07/app-store-connect-fresh-icon/">was updated with a refreshed icon</a> that's similar to the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; for Artists icon, which means Apple has now updated two app icons with this new design.

<br/>
Over <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/mlitcj/apple_just_updated_app_store_connect_apple_music/">on Reddit</a>, users are speculating that the icon changes could perhaps be indicative of more sweeping design changes set to be introduced in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/">iOS 15</a>.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/">macOS Big Sur</a> refreshed many of its icons and streamlined their design, so there is a chance that something similar could happen in &zwnj;iOS 15&zwnj;. That said, these could just be one-off updates for Apple's behind the scenes apps for developers and musicians, and not a sign of something to come.
<br/>

<br/>
We don't know much at all <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/">about iOS 15</a> at this point, but we could perhaps see some details leaking out as the software's launch date approaches. Apple is expected to debut &zwnj;iOS 15&zwnj;, iPadOS 15, watchOS 8, tvOS 15, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/">macOS 12</a> at its keynote event that will be held on June 7.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/">iOS 15</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/06/apple-music-for-artists-revamped-icon/">Apple&#039;s Revamped Apple Music for Artists Icon Leads to Speculation About iOS 15 Design Plans</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-revamped-apple-music-for-artists-icon-leads-to-speculation-about-ios-15-design-plans.2290830/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
