<ul>
<li>Mobvoi just announced the new TicWatch GTH fitness tracker.</li>
<li>Although it looks like a smartwatch, the device fits firmly in the fitness tracker category.</li>
<li>The tracker is available now at a cost of $79.99.</li>
</ul>
</div><hr>
<p>Mobvoi&#8217;s TicWatch smartwatches are some of the best in the Wear OS world. The Tic Watch Pro 3, in particular, is the best Wear OS watch available today.</p>
<p>Now, we have a new wearable from Mobvoi&#8217;s TicWatch line that looks like a smartwatch but is not a smartwatch (via <a href="https://www.wareable.com/smartwatches/ticwatch-gth-price-specs-features-release-8387"><em>Wareable</em></a>). The TicWatch GTH is a budget-minded fitness tracker in a smartwatch-esque case.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Related:Â </strong><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-fitness-trackers-707649/">The best fitness trackers: Fitbit, Garmin, Xiaomi, and more</a></p>
<p>The GTH&#8217;s plastic case has the same square-like design as the Apple Watch and its myriad clones. Inside that case is a 1.55-inch 360 x 320 LCD panel display set within a thick black bezel.</p>
<p>Along with the usual fitness tracking and heart rate monitoring, the TicWatch GTH has a skin-temp measurement sensor as well as SpO2 tracking. However, it does not have a built-in GPS, which is to be expected at this price point.</p>
<p>At just <a href="https://mobvoi.m4ibck.net/c/1327608/733475/10848?subId1=csbrown&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobvoi.com%2Fus%2Fproducts%2Fticwatchgth">$79.99</a>, the GTH has some formidable competition, including trackers from Amazfit and, in certain areas of the world, Huawei. If you&#8217;re interested in grabbing one for yourself, they are available now.</p>
