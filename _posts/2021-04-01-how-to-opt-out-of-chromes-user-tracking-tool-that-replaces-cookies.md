Cookies are part of the current web-browsing experience on desktop and mobile. They&rsquo;re meant to help with the functionality of certain websites, but are often used to track users across those very same websites. Mozilla announced recently that Firefox would make it impossible for websites to track users with cookies, and Google wants to phase them out as soon as next year as well.</p>
<p>But just because cookies are going away, it doesn't mean that user privacy is necessarily going to get better. Google and others will still want to track users. Tracking users helps Google, Facebook, and others sell more expensive targeted ads, which pays for the various apps and services these companies offer to users for free. Gmail, Google Search, and Chrome are all &ldquo;free&rdquo; of charge, but your data is what you use to pay for them.</p>
<p>Google is developing a different way to offer targeted ads that doesn&rsquo;t involve cookies. It&rsquo;s called FLoC (or Federated Learning of Cohorts), and it will be tested on Chrome users soon. But people who don&rsquo;t want to be tracked via FLoC can opt out of it.</p>
