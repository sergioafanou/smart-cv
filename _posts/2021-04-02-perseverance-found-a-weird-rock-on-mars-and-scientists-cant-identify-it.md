It landed successfully in late February and spent a good chunk of March just testing its various systems and ensuring that everything was still in working order after its long journey from Earth. Now, as the rover waits patiently for the tiny Mars helicopter Ingenuity to perform its first flights, the science team is using Perseverance to check out the rocks in the immediate area. One rock, in particular, has caught Perseverance's eye, and NASA says its scientists are debating where it came from.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere/status/1377328024991846400">a new tweet</a> published by the official Perseverance account on Twitter, the "rover" (speaking in the first person, because NASA is dorky and awesome like that) reveals that it shot the rock with a laser and is still trying to learn more about it. The rock itself is rather interesting in appearance, with large pits dotting an otherwise smooth surface.&nbsp; What is it and where did it come from? Your guess is apparently as good as NASA's.</p>
