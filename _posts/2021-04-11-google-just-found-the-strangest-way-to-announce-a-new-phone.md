For example, last summer, the company accidentally published an image of the Pixel 4a on its own internet store weeks before <a href="https://bgr.com/2020/08/03/google-pixel-4a-price-release-date-announcement/">an official announcement</a>. This latest reveal might be the strangest yet, though, as Google decided to publicly deny rumors that the unannounced Pixel 5a has been canceled, in turn announcing the phone.</p>
<p>This odd saga began when <em>Front Page Tech</em> host Jon Prosser <a href="https://twitter.com/jon_prosser/status/1380536151996559362">stated in a tweet</a> that the Pixel 5a had been canceled. His sources told him that the ongoing chip shortage which is affecting virtually every major player in the industry was the culprit behind the cancellation and that production of the phone would not be going forward. His report was later <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-5a-5g-limited-release-us-japan">corroborated by <em>Android Central</em></a>, which heard from two sources of its own that the budget phone had been canned. But as the news began to spread, Google decided to step in and squash the rumors.</p>
