<p>Online threats are one of the most dangerous aspects of our increasingly digital world. Whether you’re connected to fiber internet or on the go, there are legitimate concerns about data security, scams, and fraud. There are plenty of costly ways to keep yourself and your family safe, but one of the most sensible options is AT&amp;T ActiveArmor.</p>
<p>While you won’t ever have shining armor to protect your devices, <a href="https://andauth.co/5i9zdT">AT&amp;T ActiveArmor</a> is just about as close as you can get in the digital sphere. Here’s everything you should know.</p>
<h2>Dominant digital defense</h2>
<p>You can’t spend all day and night worrying about your wireless security, but AT&amp;T can. With 24/7 proactive network security that automatically detects and helps block fraud calls and alerts you to potential spam risks, what more could you ask for?</p>
<p>You can download the free AT&amp;T Call Protect app to customize your robocall protection and even create your own personal block list. Securing your <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-att-phones-569051/">devices</a> and data is just as important too. With the free AT&amp;T Mobile Security app, you can enable device security and receive data breach alerts and tips.</p>
<p>With AT&amp;T’s best plans, you can get enhanced Caller ID and additional advanced security features of the AT&amp;T Mobile Security app including Personal ID monitoring, Safe Browsing, and expanded Wi-Fi protection at no extra charge.</p>

<h2>Fight to protect your fiber</h2>
<p>Just like its wireless protection, ActiveArmor doesn’t take any time off when it’s protecting your fiber connection. You’ll have 24/7 smart internet protection against data threats to every connected device on your Wi-Fi network. Best of all, it comes included when you sign up for AT&amp;T Fiber at 300Mbps+ speeds</p>
<p>AT&amp;T Internet Security blocks known at-risk sites that could potentially infect your devices with malware. This protection comes built-in to guard your entire Wi-Fi network; all you need to do is opt-in within the Smart Home Manager app. It helps guard against hackers getting unauthorized access, and AT&amp;T Internet Security works proactively to clamp down on potentially suspicious transmissions.</p>
<p>It would be pretty great to lock your Wi-Fi network in a suit of armor, but AT&amp;T Internet Security seems like a solid alternative. If you’re worried about hackers, there’s a good chance that you can get some peace of mind from the big blue carrier.</p>
