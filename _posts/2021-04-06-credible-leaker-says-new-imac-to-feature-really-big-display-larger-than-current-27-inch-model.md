Credible leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/l0vetodream">l0vetodream</a> today endorsed widespread speculation that one of the newly redesigned iMacs, expected to launch sometime this year, will feature a larger display than the current largest offering in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> lineup.

<br/>

<br/>
Apple currently sells a 21.5-inch and 27-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;. Apple is rumored to be replacing both with updated designs and faster performance. Its desktop computer has not received a significant overhaul since 2012.
<br/>

<br/>
According to l0vetodream, the new model replacing the 27-inch size will feature a larger display.  The private tweet translates to "The &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;’s screen is really big, bigger than the biggest one".  
<br/>

<br/>
While new information, the larger display size can easily be expected. <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-plans-redesigned-imac-new-mac-pro-smaller-mac-pro-cheaper-monitor">Bloomberg</a></em> has reported that the new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; will feature slimmer bezels, the removal of the metal chin, and a design language similar to the Pro Display XDR. The Pro Display XDR, Apple's standalone high-end monitor, features a 32-inch display.
<br/>

<br/>
Alongside a redesign, the new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; will come equipped with next-generation Apple silicon chips. Internally, Apple is testing chips with as many as 16 high-performance cores and four efficiency cores, according to Bloomberg.
