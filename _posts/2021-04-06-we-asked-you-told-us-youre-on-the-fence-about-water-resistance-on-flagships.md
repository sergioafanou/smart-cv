<p>These days, most flagship phones — from the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-series-1147733/">Galaxy S21 trio</a> to the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-9-1170815/">OnePlus 9 series</a>, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oppo-find-x3-pro-1192195/">Oppo Find X3 Pro</a> to the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/xiaomi-mi-11-1181900/">Mi 11 Ultra</a> — come bearing official water resistance ratings. Naturally, if you&#8217;re paying top dollar for a phone, you expect it to be able to survive accidental splashes, rain, or that god-forbidden drop in the can. However, water resistance is not always present on the more affordable flagships, case in point the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/realme-gt-1203211/">Realme GT</a> or the Vivo IQOO 7.</p>
<p>So it got us thinking — How important is water resistance to you when buying a flagship phone? We polled our readers on the topic, and here&#8217;s what they had to say.</p>
<h2>How important is water resistance to you when buying a flagship?</h2>
<p><iframe style="border: none;" title="Is water resistance important to you when buying a flagship?" src="https://e.infogram.com/d8577ec1-09db-4ed8-8c28-b5ae9c4393a5?src=embed" width="100%" height="497" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our poll results show that our readers are split about having water resistance on their flagship phones. We received a total of 1,547 votes, of which a majority (34.9%) think the feature is not a priority. Still, those who voted for the option feel that water resistance is good to have on flagships.</p>
<p>A close second were the people who absolutely can&#8217;t do without water resistance on their flagship phones. 33.9% of our readers think the feature is essential and won&#8217;t buy a flagship device that doesn&#8217;t have it.</p>
<p>24.1% of the voters said water resistance is one of the several key considerations for them when buying a flagship phone. Meanwhile, 7.5% don&#8217;t care about it at all.</p>
<h2>Your Comments</h2>
<p><a href="https://disqus.com/by/lukasdvorok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lukas Dvorok</a>: Since official dust and water resistance does not last as the phone ages, it&#8217;s not that useful. Also, it&#8217;s not part of the warranty. So it&#8217;s basically a useless number on paper unless manufacturers will take it seriously and include it in the warranty.</p>
<p><a href="https://disqus.com/by/iaminf8nity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISMoney</a>: A lot of people who care about this feature haven&#8217;t learned how to care properly for their devices anyway. It&#8217;s not that difficult to remember to avoid water. They wouldn&#8217;t do it with their socks, but when it comes to their devices, they are a bit more careless.</p>
<p><a href="https://disqus.com/by/disqus_9Geou5C4cx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AnySmarterIdRunLinux</a>: I don&#8217;t forget to avoid water &#8211; I go to where the water is. And&#8230; Get this. I take my phone. And, when life happens, my phone is there to capture the moment and survive to do it another day.</p>
<p><a href="https://disqus.com/by/disqus_Wz8WEjGNAW/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Black</a>: It&#8217;s certainly nice to have as I have taken my phone with me when I took my kids in a pool.<br />
Right now I have an IP-rated phone, but I would be more than willing to trade IP for better mics, speakers, or anything more of a value for me.</p>
<p><a href="https://disqus.com/by/jdrch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jdrch</a>: I listen to podcasts in the shower with my phone on the bathroom counter, so it&#8217;s a priority for me.</p>
<p><a href="https://disqus.com/by/Bart_123456/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bart</a>: I would like to have IP68, but I just know it is useless in long-term use in the rain.<br />
Yes &#8211; the smartphone usually survives the first hour after removing it from water, but then problems start to happen &#8211; weird noises in earphones, some water marks, charging not working or not fully working, no data transfer in cable, and MILLIONS other small problems. Ask me how I know &#8211; I repair those devices on a daily basis, and I worked in a smartphone recycle factory diagnosing about 1,000 smartphones monthly. Basically, water resistance is only good if someone will sneeze on the smartphone.</p>
<p><a href="https://disqus.com/by/disqus_65g5qtTcNl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tennisfreak</a>: I don&#8217;t take my phones in water. My phone is usually in a case or bumper of some type that offers some protection against water. Water resistance is nice to have but by no means a decision-maker on whether to buy a phone or not. I&#8217;ve always wondered why so many reviewers place such a high importance on this feature.</p>
<p><a href="https://disqus.com/by/disqus_YdYamJAVwF/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mattc</a>: I&#8217;m active, sporty, and clumsy, so it&#8217;s a must.</p>
<p><a href="https://disqus.com/by/disqus_8o9yKAzrk9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mohit</a>: I would like to have a phone that can withstand splashes of water or can survive the rain. Especially if I am paying $1000+ for a phone, I don&#8217;t want it to die because it couldn&#8217;t survive a walk in the rain or an unfortunate sudden splurge of water.</p>
