The tvOS 14.5 beta that was released this morning includes a code change that references an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> remote control that features a "Center Button," which is a description that does not fit the current &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; remote.
<br/>

<br/>
"Press the center button or the touch surface to continue," reads the tvOS 14.5 code, which was discovered by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveMoser">Steve Moser</a>.
<br/>

<br/>
The remote for the fourth and fifth-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; models features a series of buttons that are arranged in two rows, with no button in the center.
<br/>

<br/>
There <em>is</em> an older "<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM4T2AM/A/apple-remote">Apple Remote</a>" with a center button that's designed for the second and third-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; models and is compatible with the current &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; models, so it's possible that's what the code change is referencing, but it could also be referring to a new unreleased &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; remote.
<br/>

<br/>
The specific code that was found is in a "setup" app, which would make more sense for a new remote rather than an older remote, but we don't know for sure that this is a reference to a new &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; remote option. If it is indeed something new, the upcoming &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; remote could perhaps feature a design similar to the remote app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, which features a large touch area, a main center Menu button, and side buttons for accessing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, play/pause, the Home screen, and search.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple is rumored to be working on a sixth-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; that will feature an upgraded A-series chip and a revamped remote control. We haven't heard details on what the remote control might look like, but it could have a "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a>" feature for location purposes when lost.
<br/>

<br/>
In an earlier beta, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/apple-siri-remote-tvos-14-5-beta/">Apple renamed</a> the "&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Remote" to the "&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; Remote," which is another possible reference to an unreleased &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; remote option.
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Update:</b> The code could be referring to a third-party &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; remote that's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/22/uei-alternative-apple-tv-4k-remote/">in development</a> and which could be offered by Universal Electronics to cable, satellite, and MVPD companies. This remote also has a circular button, and an image of it was found in the beta by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/31/exclusive-heres-our-first-look-at-the-all-new-apple-tv-remote/">9to5Mac</a></em>.
<br/>

<br/>
It's possible the Universal Electronics remote will soon be available from various cable providers who will offer it alongside the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, much like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/30/salt-remote-apple-tv/">the Salt Remote</a> sold by a Swiss telecommunications company.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/">tvOS 14</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/31/tvos-14-5-beta-6-tv-remote-center-button/">tvOS 14.5 Beta 6 References Apple TV Remote With &#039;Center Button&#039; [Updated]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tvos-14-5-beta-6-references-apple-tv-remote-with-center-button-updated.2290242/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
