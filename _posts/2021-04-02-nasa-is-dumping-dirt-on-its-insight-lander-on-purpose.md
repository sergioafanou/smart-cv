NASA has had an incredible string of luck with its Mars missions and unfortunately, it's looking increasingly like InSight will prove to be one of the more troublesome missions that the space agency has ever launched to the Red Planet. You'd think a lander mission would be a great deal easier to pull off than a rover adventure, but InSight has proven us all wrong on that front.</p>
<p>It's not that InSight has been an overall failure, but the mission has seen more than its share of challenges. The shortcomings of the self-hammering "mole" tool that was supposed to bury itself in the Martian surface but has now been given up on were a real shame, and now NASA is trying to work out how it can more accurately detect quakes on Mars in the midst of shifting weather. In <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-insight-detects-two-sizable-quakes-on-mars">a new post by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>, the InSight team reveals what it's doing to calm things down... and it's hilarious.</p>
