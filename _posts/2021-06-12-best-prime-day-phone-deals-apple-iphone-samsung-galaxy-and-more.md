<h2>When is Prime Day 2021?</h2>
<p>Prime Day 2021 is set to take place over two days, not one day. Amazon has announced that the official days for Prime Day 2021 will be June 21 and June 22, and we're expecting different deals on the different days. So, if you can't find the perfect deal for your needs on the first day, it's worth checking back on the second day.</p>
<h2>What Prime Day phone deals are expected?</h2>
<p>We're expecting a ton of great deals <a href="https://bgr.com/tag/prime-day/">on Prime Day</a>, across all kinds of brands and phone types. We'll have to wait and see whatÂ <em>exact</em> deals pop up, but rest assured that some great phones will get price cuts.</p>
<p>For starters, it's possible that we'll see at least some iPhone models. It remains to be seen whether or not the latest and greatest <a href="https://bgr.com/tag/iphone-12/">iPhone 12 series</a> gets a big price cut, but there are other models to consider too -- including the iPhone SE, the last-generation iPhone 11 series, and so on. iPhone deals aren't common on Prime Day, but it's still possible that could change this year.</p>
<p>Some Android phones will certainly get deals too. <a href="https://bgr.com/tag/samsung/">Samsung Galaxy phones</a> may end up getting the biggest discounts, including the Samsung Galaxy S21 series. Other Samsung phones, like the Samsung Galaxy A-Series, will likely get some discounts too.</p>
<p>Other phone brands that may get discounts include the likes of OnePlus, Motorola, and more.</p>
