<br/>
<h2>Magic Keyboard</h2>
<br/>
To start, you can get Apple's Magic Keyboard for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863F794B?tag=macrumors-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1"><strong>&#36;249.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;349.00. This discount has been applied automatically and doesn't require a coupon code.
<br/>

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863F794B?tag=macrumors-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;100 OFF</div>Magic Keyboard (12.9-Inch) for &#36;249.00</div></a></div>
<br/>

<br/>
Today's deal is a match of the best price ever seen on this accessory. The Magic Keyboard provides a full keyboard with a trackpad, backlit keys, and a floating cantilever design that lets you adjust the iPad Pro to find the best viewing angle.
<br/>

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863BQJMS?tag=macrumors-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;100 OFF</div>Magic Keyboard (11-Inch) for &#36;199.00</div></a></div>
<br/>

<br/>
Over the past few weeks, Amazon has been offering the 11-inch Magic Keyboard at &#36;100 off as well. This version of the accessory is priced at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863BQJMS?tag=macrumors-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1"><strong>&#36;199.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;299.00, and it's another lowest-ever price.
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>MagSafe Charger</h2>
<br/>
You can save a little bit on Apple's MagSafe Charger for the iPhone 12, priced at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MHXH3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger/dp/B08L5NP6NG?ref_=ast_sto_dp"><strong>&#36;34.00</strong></a> on Amazon, down from &#36;39.00. While this is only &#36;5 off, it's still one of the best deals we've tracked and the most consistent deal we've seen on this accessory.
<br/>

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MHXH3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger/dp/B08L5NP6NG?ref_=ast_sto_dp"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;5 OFF</div>MagSafe Charger for &#36;34.00</div></a></div>
<br/>

<br/>
The MagSafe Charger attaches directly to the corresponding magnets in the iPhone 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max, 12 mini, and regular iPhone 12 model. It's also compatible with previous generations of iPhone that support Qi charging, and it comes attached with a USB-C charging cable, but not a power adapter.
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>iPhone 12 mini Cases</h2>
<br/>
Lastly, Amazon is hosting a few discounts on accessories specifically for the iPhone 12 mini today. There's the Clear Case for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Clear-Case-iPhone-Mini/dp/B08L5MXKZP?ref_=ast_sto_dp"><strong>&#36;34.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;49.00; and the Black or Deep Navy Silicone Case for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Silicone-Case-MagSafe-iPhone/dp/B08L5NJTSS?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1"><strong>&#36;34.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;49.00.
<br/>

<br/>
These aren't best-ever prices, but they are the best around today. You can also purchase the Leather Wallet with MagSafe for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Leather-Wallet-MagSafe-iPhone/dp/B08L5P8WCZ?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1"><strong>&#36;50.28</strong></a>, down from &#36;59.00 in Black and Saddle Brown, which is an Amazon all-time low price.
