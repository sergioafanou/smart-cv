Longtime Apple supplier TSMC is set to begin mass shipments of Apple's upcoming A15 chip for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> ahead of schedule at the end of May, according to a snippet of a full report set to be published tomorrow by <em>DigiTimes</em>.

<br/>
The new chip will be based on an enhanced version of the 5nm process, which first debuted in the A14 Bionic with the 2020 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12</a> lineup. While the full report will likely offer more details as to the specifics of the new chip that will power the next-generation iPhones, it can be reasonably assumed that it will improve on performance and power efficiency.
<br/>

<br/>
Due to impacts to suppliers as a result of the global health crisis, Apple launched the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; series in October, out of the normal September timeframe. With impacts to supply chains now easing, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> believes that Apple is on track to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/12/kuo-expects-iphone-13-mass-production-on-time/">release the iPhone 13 in September</a>. With TSMC now believed to be starting mass shipments of the new chip ahead of schedule, that certainly does seem to be the case. 
<br/>

<br/>
Improved performance and power efficiency in the A15 will be one of the multiple rumored features coming to the 2021 iPhones. Information so far suggests that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/alleged-iphone-13-front-glass-photo/">Apple will relocate the earpiece</a> to the top bezel for the upcoming iPhones, resulting in a smaller notch. 
<br/>

<br/>
Internally, Apple is expected to include a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/15/iphone-13-always-on-display-stronger-magesafe/">ProMotion 120Hz and always-on-display</a> for at least some &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; models. Additional features include a rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/26/iphone-13-matt-black-stainless-steel-coating/">new matte black option</a>, improved fingerprint resistance for the stainless steel edges, and possibly an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/29/iphone-13-in-display-fingerprint-sensor-optical/">in-screen fingerprint sensor</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">digitimes.com</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/06/a15-mass-production-late-may/">Mass Production of A15 Chip for iPhone 13 Set to Begin Ahead of Schedule in Late May</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mass-production-of-a15-chip-for-iphone-13-set-to-begin-ahead-of-schedule-in-late-may.2290801/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
