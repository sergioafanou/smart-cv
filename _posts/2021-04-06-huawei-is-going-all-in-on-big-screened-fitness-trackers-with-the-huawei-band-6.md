<li>Huawei has announced a new big-screened fitness tracker called the Huawei Band 6.</li>
<li>The Huawei Band 6 is a rebranded Honor Band 6, despite the two companies separating.</li>
<li>The new fitness tracker boasts 14-day battery life and all-day blood oxygen monitoring.</li>
</ul>
</div><hr>
<p>A few months ago, Honor officially <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-sells-honor-1178129/">separated</a> from its parent company Huawei, though the DNA that tied the two together can still be seen today. Look no further than the new Huawei Band 6, a fitness tracker that&#8217;s essentially a rebranded <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/honor-band-6-fitness-tracker-1190224/">Honor Band 6</a>.</p>
<p>Honor&#8217;s device was the recipient of one of <em>Android Authority&#8217;s</em> <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/ces-2021-top-picks-awards-1192568/">CES 2021 Top Picks Awards</a>, and for good reason. The big-screen form factor and two-week-long battery life are standout features that aren&#8217;t too common in the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-cheap-fitness-trackers-1206821/">budget-friendly fitness tracker</a> space.</p>
<p>The Huawei Band 6 offers the same big 1.47-inch touchscreen AMOLED display, making it much roomier than a traditional fitness tracker. Despite its larger size, it weighs only 18g. Notably, the Huawei Band 6 also shares similarities with the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-watch-fit-review-1154792/">Huawei Watch Fit</a>. Though, the Band 6 is slightly smaller and has better battery life.</p>
<p>A big case allows room for a big battery. The Huawei Band 6 can last up to 14 days on a single charge with &#8220;average&#8221; use or 10 days with intense use.</p>

<p>The fitness tracker comes with an optical heart rate sensor, as well as all-day <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/spo2-1211078/">SpO2 monitoring</a>. Blood oxygen monitoring throughout the day is normally something we see on higher-end health-focused devices, so it&#8217;s great to see Huawei include it in the Band 6. It&#8217;ll also warn you if your blood oxygen levels dip too low throughout the day.</p>
<p>It can track your sleep, too, and report your heart rate during sleep, sleep stages, and breathing rate. Menstrual cycle tracking is also here, allowing women to track their periods, manage their pregnancy plans, and more.</p>
<p>Finally, the band supports 96 workout modes in total. Six modes can be auto-tracked: indoor/outdoor running, indoor/outdoor walking, elliptical, and rowing machine. Huawei says it can also track 11 &#8220;professional&#8221; modes, including running, cycling, and&#8230; rope skipping. We&#8217;ve asked Huawei for more details to see exactly what that means.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t expect too many smartwatch features, though. The Huawei Band 6 will be able to offer basic notification mirroring, as well as a remote camera shutter and the ability to control your phone&#8217;s music, but third-party apps are not supported.</p>
<p>The Huawei Band 6 will be available in Graphite Black, Amber Sunrise, Sakura Pink, and Forest Green sometime soon, but that&#8217;s all we know for now. There&#8217;s no word yet on pricing or availability, but the Honor Band 6 will soon be available for around $35. It&#8217;s possible Huawei&#8217;s wearable could launch at around the same price.</p>
