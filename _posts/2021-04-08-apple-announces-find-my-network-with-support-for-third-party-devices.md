Apple today announced the launch of its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a> network accessory program, which is designed to allow third-party Bluetooth devices to be tracked in the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app right alongside your Apple devices.

<br/>
According to Apple, the first accessory companies to take advantage of the new &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; integration include Belkin, Chipolo, and VanMoof, with devices set to be available beginning next week.
<br/>

<br/>
VanMoof's newest S3 and X3 e-bikes will integrate with &zwnj;Find My&zwnj;, as will Belkin's Soundform Freedom True Wireless Earbuds and the Chipolo ONE Spot item finder. Apple says that additional third-party manufacturers will offer Find My-enabled products and accessories soon.<blockquote>"For more than a decade, our customers have relied on &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; to locate their missing or stolen Apple devices, all while protecting their privacy," said Bob Borchers, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. "Now we're bringing the powerful finding capabilities of &zwnj;Find My&zwnj;, one of our most popular services, to more people with the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network accessory program. We're thrilled to see how Belkin, Chipolo, and VanMoof are utilizing this technology, and can't wait to see what other partners create."</blockquote>Apple has a strict set of rules for devices that are part of the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; Network accessory program, and all third-party products must adhere to all of the privacy protections of the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; Network.

<br/>
Participating &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; products will be able to be found in the "Items" tab and will have a "Works with Apple &zwnj;Find My&zwnj;" badge. You will be able to see &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; accessories in the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app under the Items tab, where they can be tracked like Apple products. Third-party accessories can be added to the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app on devices running iOS 14.3 and later or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/">macOS Big Sur</a> 11.1 and later. 
<br/>

<br/>
&zwnj;Find My&zwnj; accessories will be able to be tracked on a map and there will be an option to play a sound to locate a lost device. Items can be put into a Lost Mode, which locks them to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> and prevents another person from pairing to it. Items can be associated with a phone number and message in case someone finds it, and users can get notifications when an item's location becomes available. 
<br/>

<br/>
Third-party &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; devices will be able to take advantage of the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network that uses crowdsourced data from millions of Apple devices to detect missing devices or items and report an approximate location back to the owner.

<br/>
Apple today also announced a draft specification for chipset manufacturers that will be released later in the spring. It will allow third-party device manufacturers to take advantage of the Ultra Wideband technology in U1-equipped Apple devices, such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/">iPhone 11</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12</a> lineups. U1 integration will allow for a more precise, directionally aware item location experience. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/07/apple-announces-find-my-network-third-party-devices/">Apple Announces Find My Network With Support for Third-Party Devices</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-find-my-network-with-support-for-third-party-devices.2290936/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
