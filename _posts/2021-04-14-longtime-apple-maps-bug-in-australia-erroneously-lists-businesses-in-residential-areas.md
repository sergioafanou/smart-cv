There's a curious bug in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/maps/">Apple Maps</a> app that's affecting Australians, which appears to be caused by a bad data set. Multiple complaints on Twitter suggest that &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; is listing certain businesses incorrectly, directing Australians to residential areas rather than the actual business location.

<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; appears to be pulling in data from where business owners live, rather than where their businesses are located.
<br/>

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So here’s a fun stuff up:<br>I think &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; pulled in some weird business data in Australia. Now you can see the name and number of many registered businesses except not their place of business.

<br/>
There are a long list of complaints on Twitter about the errors that Australians have experienced, with restaurants, hospitals, pharmacies, and more listed in the wrong place.
<br/>

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Marulan pharmacy” - the one 125km from me is the correct one. <a href="https://t.co/9ay9A4WNOB">pic.twitter.com/9ay9A4WNOB</a></p>&mdash; David Colville (@dcolvl) <a href="https://twitter.com/dcolvl/status/1380151817351356418?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 8, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<br/>
Twitter users John Cleary and Russell Ivanovic suggest that Apple <a href="https://twitter.com/jaysee_au/status/1380152094309646341">has imported</a> an Australian business database that lists the places that businesses are registered to, which is typically the business owner's home address.
<br/>

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yeah it&#39;s quite frustrating it slapped a non-profit I&#39;m part of at my home address. Seems they somehow pulled the ABN database or something. Weird businesses all over the place.</p>&mdash; Trent Lloyd &#x1f986; (@lathiat) <a href="https://twitter.com/lathiat/status/1380333490235875332?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 9, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<br/>
The long list of Twitter complaints suggest that this problem has existed in Australia for quite some time, and at least one person confirmed that he had a business listed as located at his home address.
<br/>

<br/>
Some of the Twitter users have reported the errors, but Apple has yet to address the problem for Australians who are being misdirected.
<br/>

<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I reported the listening on the Maps app with a note asking them to remove it, I’m not sure if it will work, though!</p>&mdash; Heidi Helen Pilypas (@heidi_helen) <a href="https://twitter.com/heidi_helen/status/1380171564671373314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 8, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

Apple has had issues with the &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; app in the past, but has worked hard to introduce improvements through acquisitions and its own mapping efforts with map vehicles. &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; has gained multiple new features over the years like the street-level Look Around feature, but there are clearly still issues that need to be fixed.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/australia/">Australia</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/13/apple-maps-australia-listing-bug/">Longtime Apple Maps Bug in Australia Erroneously Lists Businesses in Residential Areas</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/longtime-apple-maps-bug-in-australia-erroneously-lists-businesses-in-residential-areas.2291577/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
