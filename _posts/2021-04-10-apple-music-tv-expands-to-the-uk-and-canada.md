&zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; TV offers a constant live stream of currently popular music videos, live shows, and events that run for 24 hours every day. Every Friday, &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; TV debuts new videos and there are appearances from ‌&zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;‌ 1 radio hosts with interviews and more.
<br/>

<br/>
The feature was initially only available in the United States, but Apple is now beginning to roll the service out internationally, starting with the UK and Canada.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple appears to be celebrating the launch of &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; TV in the UK by featuring songs from British artists such as Dua Lipa, Stormzy, Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith, and Little Mix.
