Apple is working on a new version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> that's set to be released at some point in 2021, and the new set-top box that's coming could feature support 4K 120Hz video output.
<br/>

<br/>
Evidence of 120Hz support was found in the tvOS 14.5 beta code by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/05/tvos-14-5-beta-code-suggests-120hz-support-coming-to-a-new-apple-tv-model/">9to5Mac</a></em>, with the code listing multiple instances of "120Hz and "supports120Hz." The code was found in PineBoard, Apple's name for the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; interface.
<br/>

<br/>
The references to 120Hz refresh rate support suggest that Apple is testing this feature for the next-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, and it suggests that the new set-top box will use HDMI 2.1. HDMI 2.0, used for the current fifth-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K, is limited to 4K resolution at 60Hz. HDMI 2.1, however, is able to support streaming 4K content at 120Hz.
<br/>

<br/>
As with the 120Hz refresh rate on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, a 120Hz refresh rate mode on &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; would allow for smoother performance on 120Hz television sets and would be ideal for gaming where there's a lot of quick action as you might find in shooting games.
<br/>

<br/>
There are 120Hz TVs on the market, which people generally buy for gaming purposes and use with the latest Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 consoles, both of which support the HDMI 2.1 specification and can output 4K video at 120Hz.
<br/>

<br/>
We don't yet know when the next-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; will launch, but rumors have suggested it will feature a faster processor and a redesigned remote. Some rumors also suggest that Apple is planning for an &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; that would offer a console-like gaming experience, and 4K 120Hz support would allow the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; to better compete with the latest flagship gaming consoles.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/">tvOS 14</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/05/apple-tv-120hz-support-tvos-14-5-code/">Upcoming Apple TV Could Support 120Hz Refresh Rate According to tvOS 14.5 Beta Code</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/upcoming-apple-tv-could-support-120hz-refresh-rate-according-to-tvos-14-5-beta-code.2290730/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
