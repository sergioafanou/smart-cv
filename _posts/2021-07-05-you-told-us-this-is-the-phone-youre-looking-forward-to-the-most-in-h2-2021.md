<p>We saw plenty of great phones in the first half of the year, such as the Samsung Galaxy S21 series, Xiaomi&#8217;s Mi 11 range, and the OnePlus 9 family. But there are loads more devices expected in the second half of 2021, ranging from traditional flagships to more eclectic phones.</p>
<p>So which phones are <em>Android Authority</em> readers looking forward to in the second half of the year, then? That&#8217;s exactly what we asked in a poll last week. Here&#8217;s how you voted.</p>
<h2>Which phone are you looking forward to most in H2 2021?</h2>
<p><iframe style="border: none;" title="Phone you&amp;amp;#39;re looking forward to in H2 2021" src="https://e.infogram.com/86f0b670-e433-4baa-9f5f-762052adcd86?src=embed" width="100%" height="497" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/upcoming-phones-poll-1240090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published the poll</a> on June 29 and gave readers 16 choices. But one phone range emerged as the most popular pick by far, with almost 38% of readers choosing the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-6-1207778/">Pixel 6 series</a>. More specifically, comments point to readers being curious about the camera experience, especially now that camera architect Marc Levoy has left the company. It doesn&#8217;t hurt that the first Pixel 6 series renders suggest Google is offering a radically different design and triple cameras on the XL model.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a massive gap to second place, with the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-1211655/">Galaxy S21 FE</a> accruing 10.2% of the vote. The Galaxy S20 FE made a splash thanks to its cheaper price (while still retaining core flagship features), so it stands to reason that consumer interest will be high for a sequel. But we&#8217;ve seen loads of rumors regarding the new phone, suggesting either a delay, a limited release, or a switch to Exynos power for some models.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>More Samsung coverage:</strong> <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-software-evolution-1238249/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The evolution of Samsung software — TouchWiz to Samsung Experience to One UI</a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-5a-1196405/">Google Pixel 5a</a> followed closely behind the S21 FE, accounting for 9.3% of votes and grabbing third place in our poll. And Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-iphone-13-1226617/">iPhone 13</a> series was just behind Google&#8217;s budget phone in turn, grabbing 8.7% of votes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also interesting to note that foldables didn&#8217;t do well in this poll, with the rumored Vivo foldable bringing up the rear and only accounting for 0.4% of votes. The Galaxy Z Flip 3 (1.8%), Pixel Fold (2.5%), Surface Duo 2 (3.8%), and Galaxy Z Fold 3 (5.9%) didn&#8217;t break into the upper echelons either.</p>
<p>We also saw 110 votes for &#8220;other,&#8221; translating into 6.7% of respondents. Comments point to phones like the Galaxy Note 21 (although it&#8217;s canceled this year), Galaxy XCover 5, new high-end Motorola devices, and a phone from Nothing.</p>

If it&#8217;s good, might well be in the market for Pixel 7 or some other future phone to install a GCam on. I&#8217;d like for Moto to offer a Mod-compatible Z5, but no breath held.</li>

Maybe Pixel Fold, BUT not because it&#8217;s interesting, but it would mean Google would have to finally add more features to the core of the Android &#8211; even more robust resolution scaling, maybe even changing the resolution without needing to &#8220;reload&#8221;, more flexible multitasking &#8230; but those are features only people with foldables or Android desktops would benefit.</li>
