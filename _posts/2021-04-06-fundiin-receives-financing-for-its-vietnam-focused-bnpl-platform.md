<p>Fundiin, a Vietnamese &#8216;buy now, pay later&#8217; (BNPL) service provider, has raised an undisclosed amount in a funding round co-led by 1982 Ventures and Zone Startups Ventures.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Scott Krivokopich, Managing Partner at 1982 Ventures, has joined Fundiin&#8217;s board</p>
<p>The fresh funds will go towards bankrolling market expansion plans as the BNPL startup seeks to serve a &#8220;growing waitlist of merchants and their customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Launched in 2019 by Nguyen Anh Cuong (CEO) and Vo Hoang Nam (CTO), Fundiin rides on the growing BNPL trend within Southeast Asia, where consumers only pay a third of the purchase price upfront, with the balance being automatically deducted interest-free over the next two months.</p>
<p>Cuong launched Fundiin after seeing that consumers were left with few viable options to pay for goods and services. According to him, the market is filled with predatory loans and complicated instalment products that often come with long wait times, hidden fees and high interest rates.</p>

<p>&#8220;We offer an interest-free instalment payment plan to consumers, instantly at point of sale with a single photo of ID card, making our model fundamentally better than credit cards. This facility helps retail merchants increase conversion, average order value, and reach new customers,&#8221; he shared.</p>
<p>&#8220;We co-led this financing round because we bought into Cuong&#8217;s vision of Fundiin, and have seen him adapt the model and gain traction through a difficult 2020, he has demonstrated the ability to lead a team and scale the business,&#8221; said Matt Saunders, Managing Partner at Zone Startups Ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cuong and Nam have a bias for execution, taking an early lead in Vietnam&#8217;s buy-now, pay-later space by partnering with strong brands and focusing on customer experience. We have seen foreign competitors from Indonesia and Singapore take a shot at Vietnam, only to miss the mark and pull back. Fundiin is proving that being close to the market is a huge advantage,” opined Krivokopich.</p>
