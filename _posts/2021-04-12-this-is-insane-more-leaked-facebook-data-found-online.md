A new Facebook data leak has been uncovered, this one including user phone numbers that weren't part of the initial haul <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/04/03/facebook-data-leak-533-million-user-records-leaked-online/">that was first reported this past weekend</a>. That one, in case you forgot, included such personal information from more than <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/533-million-facebook-users-phone-numbers-and-personal-data-reported-leaked-online-11617475820" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">533 million Facebook users</a> from 106 countries as their phone numbers, email addresses, birthdays, and full names.</p>
<p>On Friday, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.vice.com/amp/en/article/qj8dj5/facebook-phone-number-data-breach-telegram-bot?__twitter_impression=true">a <em>Motherboard</em> investigation</a> found an online tool whereby customers can pay to obtain the phone numbers of Facebook users who "liked" a page on the social network, with these phone numbers being separate from the previous data cache noted above.</p>
