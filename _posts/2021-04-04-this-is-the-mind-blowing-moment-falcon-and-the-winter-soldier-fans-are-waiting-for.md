Disney+ TV shows aren&rsquo;t supposed to be as big as movies when it comes to advancing the main MCU storyline. <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/03/09/marvel-movies-spoilers-disney-plus-tv-shows-not-as-important/">Kevin Feige said recently</a> that watching the shows isn&rsquo;t mandatory in order to understand the movies, but his comments only sank in <em>after</em> the <em>WandaVision</em> finale. The way the TV show is crafted invites fans to speculate on everything from the main villains, the cameos, and the multiverse. Most fan theories that attempted to predict the plot failed though, and that&rsquo;s because most of them were far too ambitious.</p>
<p>Marvel fans shouldn&rsquo;t make the same mistake twice. Instead, just enjoy <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> for what it is &mdash; and so far, the TV show is incredibly entertaining. The episodes feel like shorter Marvel movies, and the showrunners already delivered a few incredible moments when it comes to both action and character development. It&rsquo;s not just Sam (Anthony Mackie) and Bucky (Sebastian Stan) who have more time to shine. Episode 3 does more for Zemo (Daniel Br&uuml;hl) than <em>Civil War</em> ever did, and we still have three more episodes to go.</p>
<p>While you should definitely temper your expectations, there's still something big to look forward to. The most exciting <em>Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> reveal is coming in episode 5, and <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/03/29/falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-mystery-cameo-episode-5/">we still have no idea what it is</a>.
