SpaceX, which has mastered the art of landing its first stage booster, routinely recovers the vital component, refurbishes it, and then reuses it in the future. However, the second rocket stage &mdash; which jumps into action once the first stage is done burning and detaches &mdash; doesn't get nearly as lucky. It typically deorbits and burns up in the atmosphere where the friction is so great that it is essentially vaporized. However, sometimes a piece or two will make it to the ground, and that's exactly what happened after the company's March 25th launch.</p>
<p>People saw the second stage ignite in the atmosphere, reporting everything from meteorites to aliens (of course), but the vast majority of the second stage that lit up the skies was destroyed completely... but not all of it. A large chunk of the rocket, a vessel that is used to store helium and measures five feet in length, crashed into a farmer's field in Washington state. <a href="https://www.newser.com/story/304507/farmer-discovers-a-piece-of-spacex-rocket-debris.html">SpaceX had to go pick it up</a>.</p>
