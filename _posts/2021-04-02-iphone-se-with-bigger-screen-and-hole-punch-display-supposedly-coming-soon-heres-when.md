It is now April 1st, and not only is the next iPhone SE nowhere to be seen, but we have not seen any hardware from Apple since the AirPods Max were announced in December. Several prominent leakers suggested that Apple would host a virtual event in March, but that never came to pass, and now the word is that something major could be happening in April instead. Either way, we probably shouldn't expect a new iPhone.</p>
