<p>One of the most egregious mistakes that people make -- and the reason so many people's account credentials end up being found in the hands of hackers, thanks to sites like <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Have I Been Pwned</a> -- is the re-use of passwords across multiple accounts.
