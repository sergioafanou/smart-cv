<p>UI-licious, a Singapore-based user interface (UI) test automation platform, has raised US$1.5 million in a pre-Series A funding round led by Monk&#8217;s Hill Ventures.</p>
<p>The fresh funds will go towards expanding its product development and sales and marketing teams. This is part of a larger effort to increase its customer base.</p>
<p>Co-founded in 2016 by Shi Ling Tai and Eugene Cheah, UI-licious allows software teams to test and monitor user journeys for their web applications across browsers. The company claims its no-code platform reduces the time needed to write a test by up to 80 per cent.</p>
<p>UI-licious currently serves customers including Daimler and Jones Lang LaSalle, who use the solution to deliver digital e-commerce experiences for their customer-facing applications and backend systems. Glints, a tech-enabled recruitment firm, also uses UI-licious to test their products before they are released to the market.</p>

<p>&#8220;Currently, 90 per cent of software teams worldwide rely on manual testing which is laborious, intensive, and costly. We created UI-licious because the software industry needs a UI test automation solution that is robust, scalable, and cost-effective &#8212; while being as simple as possible,&#8221; said CEO Tai.</p>
<p>&#8220;It does not require technical expertise or additional manpower. We believe that automating tests for software will be the norm and standard practice rather than an exception,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shi Ling and Eugene have developed a product to address the quality assurance issues that have plagued the software automation industry for decades,&#8221; noted Justin Nguyen, Partner at Monk&#8217;s Hill Ventures,</p>
<p>&#8220;They have shown maturity, growth, and tenacity in pursuing their mission &#8211; to rid the world of software bugs. The team’s experience as software engineers has equipped them with the technical knowledge and insights to build a simple and robust tool that empowers manual testers to automate testing and detect bugs before users do,&#8221; he noted.</p>
