<p>Xiaomi sub-brand Redmi has been <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/redmi-gaming-phone-1194361/">teasing</a> its first gaming smartphones since the beginning of the year. The company has now disclosed via <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4625460585040713" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weibo</a> that the Redmi gaming phone will launch at the end of April.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s General Manager, Lu Weibing, also revealed the reasons for launching the gaming device in a machine-translated <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4625469771613281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post on Weibo</a>, giving us a few hints about what to expect from it.</p>
<p>According to Weibing, gaming and e-sports are the next big areas of focus for the company. He said that 70% of Redmi users are young and spend a lot of time gaming. So the company decided to bring together a bunch of its product managers and engineers who love gaming to create the dedicated Redmi gaming phone.</p>
<p>Weibing also commented that most <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-phone-for-gaming-787194/">gaming flagships</a> out there are expensive, unusual in appearance, and bulky. They&#8217;ve always targeted a niche category of geek players. According to him, many use existing gaming phones as their spare handset and not a daily driver.</p>
<p>The Redmi gaming phone will address all these issues and will be a &#8220;normal&#8221; mobile phone. Weibing said that the company has also considered the daily usability of the device in addition to making it a gaming-centric phone. The phone has apparently gone through many design changes throughout its development cycle. Weibing claims it&#8217;ll be the &#8220;lightest and thinnest hardcore gaming flagship&#8221; on the market.</p>
<p>Redmi has also promised to maintain its brand&#8217;s price-to-performance ratio. Weibing confirmed that the upcoming phone will be affordable so that more people can experience it compared to current gaming phones.</p>
<p>The device will most likely be powered by the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/mediatek-dimensity-1200-1193238/">MediaTek Dimensity 1200</a> processor, as previously <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/redmi-gaming-phone-1194361/">teased</a> by the company. The chipset features software-driven ray tracing and 168Hz refresh rate support. Although, the GPU on it is from last year&#8217;s flagship SoC.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no word on whether the Redmi gaming phone will have physical inputs or not. However, Weibing did say in his post that the company has focused on &#8220;performance, display, and control.&#8221;</p>
