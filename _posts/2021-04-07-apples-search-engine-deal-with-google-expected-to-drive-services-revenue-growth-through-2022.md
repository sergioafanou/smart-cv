Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty today raised her services-related revenue forecast for Apple through the 2022 fiscal year.

<br/>
In a research note shared with MacRumors, Huberty said stronger licensing revenue is the primary driver of the raised estimates, including an acceleration in the search traffic-related payments Apple receives from Google. <em>The New York Times</em> last year reported that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/25/google-apple-search-default-8-12-billion/">receives an estimated &#36;8-12 billion per year</a> in exchange for making Google the default search engine on devices like the iPhone and iPad.
<br/>

<br/>
"Following strong March quarter App Store results and an analysis of the key drivers of Apple's Licensing & Other segment, we raise our already above-street FY21 and FY22 Services revenue estimates by 3% and 5% respectively, and are increasingly convinced that consensus Services forecasts over the next 2+ years are too low," wrote Huberty.
<br/>

<br/>
Despite the positive outlook on Apple's services, Huberty lowered her 12-month price target for Apple to &#36;155 from &#36;164 per share.
<br/>

<br/>
"However, multiple compression over the last 2 months, primarily at Apple's higher growth Services peers, more than offsets our higher revenue and earnings estimates, driving our new sum-of-the-parts based price target to &#36;156, or 33x FY22 EPS, down from &#36;164 previously," wrote Huberty.
