Apple today announced that it will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/13/apple-event-april-23-announcement/">hosting a virtual event on Tuesday, April 20</a> at 10 a.m. Pacific Time, and one of the new products expected to be unveiled at the event is a new iPad Pro with a Mini-LED display.

<br/>
In a <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/backgrounders/features/snapshots.asp#s4">brief snippet shared with paid subscribers</a>, Taiwanese supply chain news website <em>DigiTimes</em> today reported that Apple supplier Ennostar has substantially improved its yield rates for Mini-LED chips and is expected to scale up its output for the new iPad Pro starting later this month. This lines up with a timeframe shared by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who claimed that the new iPad Pro would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/kuo-12-9-inch-mini-led-ipad-pro-production/">enter mass production in mid-to-late April</a>.
<br/>

<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and Debby Wu recently reported that Apple plans to introduce new iPad Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/high-end-ipad-pro-mini-led-production-issue/">in the latter half of April</a>, which lines up with the now-confirmed April 20 event. The report said Mini-LED backlighting will be exclusive to the new 12.9-inch model, while both the 11-inch and 12.9-inch models are expected to get a faster A14X chip on par with the M1 chip in Macs and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/thunderbolt-ipad-pro-coming-in-april/">Thunderbolt support</a>. Early rumors also suggested that cellular models will gain support for faster 5G networking like iPhone 12 models.
<br/>

<br/>
Gurman and Wu said that due to poor manufacturing yields, the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro could ship later and be available in constrained quantities to begin with, unless suppliers like Ennostar have managed to quickly improve production.

In a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-13/apple-to-hold-first-product-unveiling-of-the-year-on-april-20">follow-up report</a> today, Gurman said that Apple is also working on its long-awaited <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags item trackers</a> and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/apple-redesigned-imacs-slimmer-bezels/">redesigned iMac</a>, but it is less certain if those products will be announced at the April 20 event. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/22/2021-apple-tv-rumors/">A new Apple TV</a> with a faster chip, redesigned remote, and a stronger gaming focus is also rumored to be in the pipeline.
<br/>

<br/>
On the software side, Apple has been beta testing iOS 14.5 for over two months now, and a final release around the April 20 event is likely. The software update has a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/everything-new-in-ios-14-5-beta/">long list of new features</a>, including the much-awaited ability for Apple Watch users to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/01/ios-14-5-unlock-iphone-with-apple-watch/">unlock their iPhone with Face ID while wearing a mask</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">digitimes.com</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/13/mini-led-ipad-pro-april-20-apple-event/">Mini-LED iPad Pro Expected at Apple Event on April 20 as Production Ramps Up</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mini-led-ipad-pro-expected-at-apple-event-on-april-20-as-production-ramps-up.2291561/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
