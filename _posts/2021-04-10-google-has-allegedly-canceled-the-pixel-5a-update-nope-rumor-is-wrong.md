<li>According to two sources speaking with <em>Android Central</em>, the Google Pixel 5a was rumored to be canceled. However, the rumor was then debunked by Google.</li>
<li>The alleged reasoning behind the original cancelation rumor was the ongoing global chip shortage.</li>

<p><strong>Update, April 9, 2021 (01:22 PM ET): </strong>Not long after publishing the article below, Google issued us a statement on the matter. Here is what a Google spokesperson had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pixel 5a 5G is not cancelled. It will be available later this year in the U.S. and Japan and announced in line with when last year’s a-series phone was introduced.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not only does this confirm that there will, in fact, be a Pixel 5a, but it also confirms that it will support 5G connections. Stay tuned for more info!</p>

<p><strong>Original article, April 9, 2021 (12:43 PM ET): </strong>Over the past few months, we&#8217;ve seen a few rumors leak out related to Google&#8217;s next expected budget phone, the Pixel 5a. We&#8217;ve even seen renders of the phone from reliable leaker @onleaks (see above). However, a new report from <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-5a-reportedly-canceled"><em>Android Central</em></a> suggests that the phone might not make it to launch.</p>
<p>According to the report, two sources confirmed with <em>AC</em> that Google has canceled the Pixel 5a entirely. The reasoning behind the alleged cancelation is the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/computer-chip-shortage-1212941/">ongoing global chip shortage</a>, which would make perfect sense. The shortage has already <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-note-2022-1209176/">prevented Samsung</a> from launching the next iteration of its Galaxy Note phones.</p>

<p>With no Pixel 5a, the 2020 &#8220;a&#8221; phones from Google would likely remain in production throughout 2021. This would be a big change from what Google did with the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-3a-review-986460/">Pixel 3a</a>, which it discontinued around the launch of the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-4a-1047299/">Pixel 4a</a>.</p>
<p>We expected the Google Pixel 5a to land in May at <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-io-2021-1216024/">Google I/O 2021</a>, which the company confirmed earlier this week. However, it appears that might not happen.</p>
<p>We reached out to Google to get confirmation on this, but have yet to hear back. We will update this article should Google issue a statement.</p>
