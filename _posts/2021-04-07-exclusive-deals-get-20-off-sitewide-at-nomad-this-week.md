<br/>
Nomad does sell an iPhone 12 Series of cases that include MagSafe compatibility, with prices starting at &#36;59.95 for the Rugged Case and &#36;79.95 for the Rugged Folio. Some of these products have been backordered and will have a delayed shipment, but only by a few days (around April 9). 
<br/>

<br/>
When you're shopping, just remember that the <strong>MACRUMORS</strong> code only works on full-priced items and not on anything already marked down.
