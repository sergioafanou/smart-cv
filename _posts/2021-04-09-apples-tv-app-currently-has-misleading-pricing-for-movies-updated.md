The TV app available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, Mac, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> has an issue with inaccurate price listings for some titles, a <em>MacRumors</em> reader discovered this morning.
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
The "Movies" section of the TV app has a "Browse by Price" section that lists movies for &#36;4.99, &#36;6.99, &#36;7.99, and &#36;9.99, but many of the movies available in those sections are more expensive.
<br/>

<br/>
In the &#36;4.99 section, for example, there are movies that include "10 Things I Hate About You," "Mean Girls," "Napoleon Dynamite," "The 40-Year-Old Virgin," "Crazy Stupid Love," "The Witch," and many more that are far more expensive than &#36;4.99.
<br/>

<br/>
Most of the titles, in fact, are &#36;14.99, with the exception of "10 Things I Hate About You," which is &#36;17.99. There are fewer errors in the &#36;6.99 and up sections, but there are still some issues. "Now You See Me," for example, is listed in the &#36;12.99 section, but is priced at &#36;4.99.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple also has pricing errors in other parts of the TV app. In the section "Family Movie Night" that's advertising movies under &#36;10 for a limited time, "Mulan" is listed, but when you click on it, it's priced at &#36;19.99. The same is true of "Onward," "The New Mutants," and several other movies that are shown in the section.
<br/>

<br/>
Clicking on the "Family Movie Night" section sometimes displays a different set of movies than are shown on the main page and sometimes it displays the movies with inaccurate pricing, so it's not quite clear what's going on with the TV app, but Apple definitely has some serious errors to address.
<br/>

<br/>
These errors are persistent across the TV app on multiple platforms, including Mac, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;.
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Update:</b> Apple has now removed the browse by pricing options from the TV app, as well as the Family Movie Night section that was listing inaccurate pricing for movies. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-apps/">Apple TV apps</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/apple-tv-app-misleading-movie-pricing/">Apple&#039;s TV App Currently Has Misleading Pricing for Movies [Updated]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-tv-app-currently-has-misleading-pricing-for-movies-updated.2291079/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
