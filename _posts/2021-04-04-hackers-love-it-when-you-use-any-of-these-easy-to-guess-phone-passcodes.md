Many of the worst and highest-profile <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/03/23/data-breach-flagstar-bank-ransomware-attack/">hacks</a>, intellectual property thefts, systems intrusions, and <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/03/03/zee5-data-breach-reported-9-million-users-exposed/">data breaches</a> that you read about are often made possible by making people fall for one of the oldest tricks in the hacker's playbook -- convincing people to click on a link or a message that they should instead avoid like the plague.</p>
<p>The same extends to the security protections that we end-users put on everything from applications and software that we use, to hardware like our computers and smartphones. A good example of this, and where many people fall short maybe without even realizing it, is in the iPhone passcode they choose to lock their device with (or the Android smartphone passcode, as the case may be).</p>
