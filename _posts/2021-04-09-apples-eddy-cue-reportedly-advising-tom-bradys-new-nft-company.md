NFL star quarterback Tom Brady is teaming up with entrepreneur Richard Rosenblatt to launch a new NFT company called <a href="https://autograph.io/">Autograph</a> this spring, and Apple executive Eddy Cue will serve as an advisor to the company, according to <em><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/06/tech/tom-brady-nft-autograph/index.html">CNN</a></em>.

<br/>
As a Senior Vice President at Apple, Cue oversees many of the company's services, such as Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Maps, and iCloud. Once a fixture at Apple Events, Cue has maintained a relatively low profile over the last few years, at least in the public eye. One of Cue's last appearances <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/22/british-telecom-5g-iphones-eddy-cue-video/">was in September 2020</a>, when he praised British carrier EE's launch of smartphone plans bundled with multiple Apple services.

<br/>
It is not uncommon for Apple executives to serve as board members or advisors to other companies, with Cue also sitting on Ferrari's board.

NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are the latest cryptocurrency phenomenon. A non-fungible token is essentially a digital commodity like an image that has been authenticated with the same blockchain technology behind Ethereum. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey's first-ever tweet sold as an NFT for &#36;2.9 million last month amid the NFT craze.
