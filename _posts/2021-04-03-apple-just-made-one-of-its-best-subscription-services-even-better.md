<p>As such, it's easy to see why Apple spends so much time advertising and talking about its assortment of services, but one service has been more or less forgotten along the way. Apple Arcade launched in September 2019, and while the service does contain a few gems (<a href="https://bgr.com/2019/09/16/apple-arcade-preview-release-date-launch-titles/">some of which I previewed</a>), it hasn't taken off the way that Apple Music did. Apple is hoping to change that by giving Apple Arcade its biggest expansion since its launch.</p>
