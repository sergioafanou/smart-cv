Trading a smartphone back in to a retailer or the company that made it can be incredibly demoralizing, but in a surprising turn of events, Apple has actually raised the trade-in value for a wide selection of its products, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/05/apple-ipad-select-mac-iphone-11-trade-in-value/">according to <em>MacRumors</em></a>.</p>
<p>As <em>MacRumors</em> notes, Apple last updated the trade-in value of its hardware lineup in December, but adjusted the values once again over the weekend. In order to determine the amount of money you can potentially receive for your old device, you'll have to answer some questions on Apple's website about the brand, model, and condition. If your device is in perfect condition, chances are that you will receive most or all of the maximum value listed on the website. And as of today, those maximum values have changed for select iPhone, iPad, and Mac models.</p>
