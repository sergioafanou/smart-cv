According to market data compiled by <em><a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/top-10-best-selling-smartphone-models-jan/">Counterpoint Research</a></em>, Apple's smallest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> since the 2016 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a>, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12 mini</a>, struggled to obtain a spot in the top five list of best-selling smartphones in January of this year.

According to the market data, the &zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj; came in eighth place for the best-selling smartphone worldwide in the first month of the year. However, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/">iPhone 12 Pro Max</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/">iPhone 12 Pro</a>, and last yearâ€™s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/">iPhone 11</a> enjoyed dominance at the top of the list.

<br/>
The 5.4-inch &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; has widely been reported to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/iphone-12-mini-sales-lackluster-cirp/">to have suffered from disappointing sales</a>, with Apple even <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/09/iphone-12-mini-production-cut-report/">reportedly cutting production</a> due to "far lower" than expected demand. The smaller handset includes the same features as the larger 6.1-inch &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj;, including the same camera system, chip, and overall design. The mini, however, includes a significantly smaller battery, and obviously, a less immersive display.
<br/>

<br/>
Despite its struggles, Apple is still reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/15/iphone-13-mini-expected-despite-12-sales/">planning to keep the 5.4-inch form factor</a> alive in the 2021 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> lineup. The newer handset, alongside the rest of the lineup, will likely benefit from improved battery life thanks to the power efficiency of the A15, which should address concerns from &zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj; customers about short battery life.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/counterpoint/">Counterpoint</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-12">iPhone 12 (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/09/iphone-12-mini-smartphone-list-for-january-2021/">iPhone 12 Mini Missing From Top 5 Best Selling Smartphone List of January 2021</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-12-mini-missing-from-top-5-best-selling-smartphone-list-of-january-2021.2291167/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
