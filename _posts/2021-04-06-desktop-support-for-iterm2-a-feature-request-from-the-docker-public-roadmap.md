<p>The latest Docker Desktop release, 3.2, includes support for iTerm2 which is a terminal emulator that is highly popular with macOS fans. From the Containers/Apps Dashboard, for a running container, you can click `CLI` to open a terminal and run commands on the container. With this latest release of Docker Desktop, if you have installed iTerm2 on your Mac, the CLI option opens an iTerm2 terminal. Otherwise, it opens the Terminal app on Mac or a Command Prompt on Windows. </p>



<p>Of note, this feature request to support additional terminals started from the Docker public roadmap. Daniel Rodriguez, one of our community members, submitted the <a href="https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4273">request</a> to the public roadmap. 180 people upvoted that request and <a href="https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/98">we added it and prioritized it</a> on our public roadmap. </p>



<p>The public roadmap is our source of truth for community feedback on prioritizing product updates and feature enhancements. Not everything submitted to the public roadmap will end up as a delivered feature, but the support for M1 chipsets, image vulnerability scanning and audit logging &#8211; all delivered within the last year &#8211; all started as issues submitted via the roadmap.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
