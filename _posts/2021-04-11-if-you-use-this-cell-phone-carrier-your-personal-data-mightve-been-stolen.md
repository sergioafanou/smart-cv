The massive Facebook hack from August 2019 come back to haunt more than 533 million users whose personal data ended up in the hands of hackers. Even <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/04/07/facebook-533-million-hack-mark-zuckerberg-phone-number-signal/">Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s account</a> was included on the list, yet <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/04/08/facebook-data-breach-2021-how-to-check-no-official-help/">Facebook will not notify users</a> who might have been impacted. A similar hack involving scraped personal data for <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/08/tech/linkedin-data-scraped-hacker-site/index.html">500 million LinkedIn accounts</a> was also disclosed, and the massive database of info was on sale online earlier this week. Then we saw <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/04/11/facebook-data-leak-new-phone-numbers-found-online/">a different data leak</a> that allowed people to obtain the phone numbers of Facebook users who liked a page on the social network. Next up, a large number of <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/04/08/data-breach-leaks-credit-card-records-and-social-security-numbers/">credit card records and Social Security numbers</a> were hacked on a platform that sells this type of stolen information &mdash; that&rsquo;s to say that data had been stolen before this security exploit, but now it has been made available more widely. Finally, we also saw <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/04/07/android-malware-flixonline-fake-netflix-app-removed-from-google-play-store/">malware-spreading Android apps</a> in the wild again, and <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/04/09/facebook-virus-ads-clubhouse-app-pc-fake/">Facebook allowed ads for a malware app</a> on its platform.</p>
<p>To top it all off, there&rsquo;s another vulnerability that millions of people need to be aware of. A small mobile operator failed to protect its customers' personal data, so anyone was able to access account information by simply inputting a phone number into a mobile app.</p>
