Well, maybe not you specifically, but humans have dominated the food chain for some time. We didn't get here because we're bigger or stronger than every other animal on the planet &mdash; in fact, there are a lot of animals that could dispatch us without a second thought if they really wanted to &mdash; but because we're smarter. The question that scientists want to answer is when did we achieve top predator status, and how did that happen.</p>
<p>A new research paper by scientists at Tel Aviv University attempts to answer that burning question, looking back over the history of humanity and painting a picture of humanity's rise to the top. They were able to do this by crunching a massive amount of data gathered over decades of research and roughly 400 different scientific papers, eventually reaching a conclusion that humans were apex predators for approximately 2 million years.</p>
