This came as no surprise after Disney revealed that it would be launching its own streaming service, but it does leave a hole on Netflix that was previously filled with some of Marvel's biggest blockbusters.</p>
<p>Filling that hole is an incredibly tall task, but few tasks are too tall for Netflix, which despite losing Marvel movies to Disney+, <em>Friends</em> to HBO Max, and <em>The Office</em> to Peacock, is still the top dog in the streaming world. One of the ways Netflix plans to replace the seemingly irreplaceable Marvel filmography is with its own superhero cinematic universe of sorts. Back in 2017, <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-acquires-millarworld-1">Netflix acquired Mark Millar's Millarworld imprint</a> and announced plans to turn the comic book franchises into shows and movies. The first of those shows will be <em>Jupiter's Legacy</em>.</p>
