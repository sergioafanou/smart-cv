<ul>
<li>WhatsApp is working on a chat migration feature for iOS and Android users.</li>
<li>The feature would let those on iPhones transfer their old chats to their new Android device.</li>
<li>It forms part of WhatsApp&#8217;s previously leaked multiple device support revamp.</li>
</ul>
</div><hr>
<p>WhatsApp has long allowed <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-phones-568001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android phone</a> users to transfer their chat history to other Android devices. But according to a new leak, the company may soon allow iOS users to transfer their data to Android phones, too.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-to-allow-chat-history-migration-between-ios-and-android/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>WABetaInfo</em></a>, the feature will form part of WhatsApp&#8217;s overarching <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/whatsapp-multiple-device-1141533/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple device system</a>, which was first hinted at early last year. That feature would effectively allow users to run WhatsApp on iOS and Android devices simultaneously. It&#8217;s understandable, then, that the chat app needed a way to transfer chats between the two platforms.</p>

<p>Before initiating a transfer, iOS users will be required to update their WhatsApp version. Additionally, WhatsApp will likely allow transfers from Android to iOS, too, but there&#8217;s no clear evidence of this just yet.</p>
<p>While the new evidence of the transfer feature points to its active development, it&#8217;s not quite ready for a prime-time introduction just yet. While <em>WABetaInfo</em> shared a screenshot showcasing the feature&#8217;s splash screen, there are no details on its availability. Considering that multiple device support has been in the works for nearly two years now, we wouldn&#8217;t hold our breath on this feature debuting soon.</p>
