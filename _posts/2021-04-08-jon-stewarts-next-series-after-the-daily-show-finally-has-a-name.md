In the years since, the comedian has made appearances on some shows and has continued producing and directing, but any plans to once again host a show of his own have repeatedly fallen through. At one point, Stewart had been tapped to host a show on HBO -- the same network where former <em>Daily Show</em> correspondent John Oliver hosts <em>Last Week Tonight</em> -- but nothing ever materialized. Now, at long last, Jon Stewart appears to be ready for his comeback.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2021/04/apple-reveals-series-title-for-jon-stewarts-highly-anticipated-return-to-television-as-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-to-debut-in-fall-2021-on-apple-tv/">Officially announced on Wednesday</a>, the comedian will return to host <em>The Problem with Jon Stewart</em> on Apple TV+ later this fall. He will also executive produce the current affairs series, which will focus on a single issue per episode -- hence the name. Beyond current events, he will also cover issues related to his advocacy work.</p>
