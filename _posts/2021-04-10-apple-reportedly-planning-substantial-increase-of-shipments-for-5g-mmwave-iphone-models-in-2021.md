Apple is expected to substantially increase shipments of mmWave enabled <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models in 2021 thanks to the increased demand and improved global support for the newer technology, according to <em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20210409PD200.html">DigiTimes</a></em>.

<br/>
Apple currently only offers mmWave-enabled <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12</a> models in the United States and is likely to hold off on offering the option to more countries until the technology is more widely available. According to <em>DigiTimes</em>, that wider availability will take place this year, and as a result, Apple is set to increase shipments of mmWave iPhones. 
<br/>
<blockquote>Apple is expected to boost its 5G mmWave smartphone shipment goal for 2021 as the global economy is on track for stable recovery, and its demand for AiP modules supporting mmWave iPhones will grow remarkably this year, the sources said.
<br/>

<br/>
In 2020, Apple lowered its 5G mmWave &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; shipment projections as construction of the corresponding infrastructure in the US and Europe was severely dragged down by the pandemic.</blockquote>The &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; was the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to feature 5G connectivity. 5G connection includes two types of networks, mmWave, which is considered to be the next widely adopted standard that offers super-fast speeds, and a 6GHz connection that is currently the conventional option worldwide. mmWave networks work through higher frequency radio bands that can range from 24Ghz to as high as 40Ghz. 
<br/>

<br/>
Due to their increased frequency, mmWave is extremely limited in range and requires more advanced and expensive infrastructure compared to 6GHz. Cities and countries around the world are still very much in the early stages of adopting mmWave technology. Even in cities where mmWave technology is present, real-world 5G speeds can differ greatly depending on your proximity to the mmWave tower and the device you're using.
<br/>

<br/>
When we tested Verizon's mmWave network with a Samsung Galaxy S10 5G smartphone in Chicago in mid-2019, we reached speeds as high as almost 2GBs. Still, we found that speeds vary drastically depending on your location and other factors.
