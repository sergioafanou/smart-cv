That&rsquo;s the kind of <em>Avengers</em> sequel everybody wants following the massive success of <em>Endgame</em> and the MCU as a whole. Of course, there&rsquo;s a very good reason for that. The MCU is in a reconstruction phase after the monumental events in <em>Endgame</em>, and we&rsquo;ve just begun to explore that world with <em>WandaVision</em> and <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em>. We&rsquo;ll see plenty of new heroes and villains introduced in upcoming films and TV shows, and we&rsquo;ll get to explore some of these characters better than ever before via the Disney+ shows.</p>
<p>Additional teams of gifted beings are about to be introduced. <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/03/31/marvel-movies-spoilers-eternals-full-plot-leak/">The <em>Eternals</em> are coming</a>, and Marvel&rsquo;s <em>Fantastic Four</em> reboot was confirmed. The X-Men will also drop in the MCU, likely rebranded simply as mutants, and <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/03/30/marvel-movies-spoilers-doctor-strange-2-avengers-crossover/">movies like <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em></a> will deliver additional epic crossovers. All of that needs to happen before the new Avengers team is fully formed. Now, a new leak teases that we might get all sorts of Avengers content covering team-ups that haven&rsquo;t been explored so far, and they won&rsquo;t necessarily qualify as actual Avengers movies. Mind you, <strong>some potential spoilers follow below</strong>.</p>
