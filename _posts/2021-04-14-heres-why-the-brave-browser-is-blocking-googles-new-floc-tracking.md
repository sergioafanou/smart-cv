Called FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts), the tool will collect your internet browsing history and assign you to a cohort of users. Google says that FLoC is a technology that will improve user privacy while still allowing it to sell personalized ads online, which increases its bottom line.</p>
<p>FLoC has received plenty of criticism so far, just as Google started a pilot that automatically enrolls many Chrome users into FLoC tracking without their knowledge. The fact that the test isn&rsquo;t opt-in for users is pretty telling of Google&rsquo;s intention to have FLoC enabled by default. As it is right now, you won&rsquo;t find FLoC-blocking language in the Settings app to prevent Google from tracking you with the tech if you get recruited in the pilot. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) created a website <a href="https://bgr.com/tech/google-chrome-floc-tracking-how-to-check-opt-out-eff-5918938/">to tell you if you&rsquo;re &ldquo;FLoCed,&rdquo;</a> and there is a way to opt out of tracking &mdash; <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/04/01/chrome-user-tracking-how-to-opt-out-floc/">you have to disable third-party cookies in Chrome</a>. The EFF has voiced its FLoC concerns quite loudly in the past few weeks, explaining why the tech is a terrible idea for users, potentially leading to privacy issues.</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s competitors have started deploying anti-FLoC products. <a href="https://bgr.com/tech/google-chrome-tracking-duckduckgo-blocks-flock-5919010/">DuckDuckGo Search will disable FLoC tracking</a> by default, and the company updated its Chrome extension to block FLoC. Brave, the private browser that pays you to see ads, will also block FLoC tracking online. That&rsquo;s not a surprise. But the company also penned a lengthy blog post to explain why FLoC is bad for privacy, and everyone should opt out of it, whether it&rsquo;s end-users or websites.</p>
