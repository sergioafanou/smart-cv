<li>Chinese phone maker Vivo has promised three years of major Android updates for future flagships.</li>
<li>The new policy will kick in for Vivo&#8217;s X series phones launching after July 2021.</li>
<li>Phones releasing in India, Australia, and Europe will be eligible for the extended Android updates.</li>

</div><hr>
<p>Looks like Samsung has <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-android-updates-1148888/">kicked off</a> a trend of extended software updates in the Android smartphone world. Last week, Chinese phone maker Oppo announced that the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oppo-find-x3-pro-1192195/">Find X3 series</a> will get three years of software support. Now, the firm&#8217;s sister brand Vivo has also jumped on the bandwagon and announced three years of Android updates for its flagship X series phones.</p>
<p>Vivo will provide three major Android OS upgrades and security updates for select models launching after July 2021. This means phones like the recently launched <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/vivo-x60-series-launch-1211520/">Vivo X60 series</a> or last year&#8217;s <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/vivo-x50-pro-review-1139636/">X50 phones</a> won&#8217;t be eligible for three Android updates.</p>
<p>&#8220;Featuring top-of-the-line hardware, the X series flagship phones are built to last â€“ and we want to make sure that our customers get software support that lives up to their expectations,&#8221; <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vivo-commits-to-three-years-of-android-upgrades-for-future-premium-x-series-devices-301286977.html#:~:text=SHENZHEN%2C%20China%2C%20May%209%2C,models%20launching%20after%20July%202021." target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> Yujian Shi, Senior Vice President and CTO of Vivo.</p>
<p>Vivo&#8217;s new software update policy includes future flagship phones launching in Europe, India, and Australia. The existing premium X series models that aren&#8217;t eligible will continue to receive regular Android security updates.</p>
<p>While Vivo&#8217;s move to provide more Android updates is a step in the right direction, it&#8217;s unfortunate that only the company&#8217;s flagship phones will benefit from it. Samsung, on the other hand, has also <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-a-update-3-years-1216026/">extended</a> three years of Android OS updates to its cheaper Galaxy A phones.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we hope other phone makers, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/xiaomi-miui-software-consistency-1219552/">especially Xiaomi</a>, also take a cue from the growing number of brands committing to three years of Android updates. Else, they&#8217;ll find it increasingly difficult to compete in a day and age where customers consider long-term software support as <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/major-android-updates-poll-results-1151041/">an important factor</a> before buying new phones.</p>
