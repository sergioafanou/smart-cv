<p>Australian fintech company Finder has bought Singapore-based GoBear&#8217;s brand, including its trademark and digital assets.</p>
<p>Digital assets bought include domains, website content and GoBear&#8217;s social media channels in seven markets, including Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand.</p>
<p>As per the deal, GoBear&#8217;s website content will be integrated into Finder. However, its social media and email channels will continue to remain independent.</p>
<p>The financial terms of the deal remain undisclosed.</p>
<p>GoBrear had <a rel="follow" rel="follow" href="https://e27.co/vcs-backed-finance-products-comparison-platform-gobear-shuts-down-20210105/">ceased operations</a> early this year.</p>
<p>Finder said in an official note that there is a great alignment between the two brands, and the acquisition can lead it to further strengthen its presence in Singapore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like GoBear, Finder is committed to helping customers improve their financial wellbeing and our mission is to help people all over the world make better money-related decisions every day. We want to continue to honour GoBear&#8217;s vision and are proud to be continuing to serve the people of Southeast Asia,&#8221; the Finder said.</p>

<p>&#8220;They [GoBear] had developed thousands of guides and education pieces, which were aligned with the way Finder approaches comparison, so those articles will now go live on Finder,&#8221; Finder&#8217;s founder and CEO Frank Restuccia said in an interview with <em><a rel="follow" href="https://mumbrella.com.au/finder-expands-presence-in-asia-plans-for-global-app-roll-out-675564">Mumbrella</a></em>.</p>
<p>Founded in 2015 by CTO Ivonne Bojoh and Chief Commercial Officer Marnix Zwart (both left the firm in November 2019), GoBear operates a platform for insurance, banking and lending products in seven markets across Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>GoBear was initially meant to be a metasearch engine, before making a transition into financial services. As of May 2020, it had over 100 commercial partners, including banks and insurance providers, and its services were used by over 55 million people.</p>
<p>The GoBear platform was shut down in January this year amid the COVID-19 crisis, as demands for its financial products and services plummeted.</p>
<p>Founded in 2006 in Sydney, Finder also helps people make better financial decisions by comparing different financial products. It compares more than 200 different verticals ranging from personal finance products such as credit cards, home loans and savings accounts to online shopping, cryptocurrency, and share trading.</p>
<p>Today, it has offices in Australia, the US, the UK, Canada, Poland and the Philippines, and claims to be serving more than 10 million consumers across 80+ countries every month.</p>
