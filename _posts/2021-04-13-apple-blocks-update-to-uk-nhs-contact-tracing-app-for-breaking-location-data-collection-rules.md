Apple and Google have blocked an update to England and Wales' contact tracing app that included a feature that would have collected user location data, breaking the companies' terms and conditions for contact tracing apps, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56713017"><em>BBC</em> reports</a>.

<br/>
Last year, Apple and Google partnered up to announce a COVID-19 contact tracing API that allows apps to track whether someone has been in contact with an individual who has tested positive for COVID-19. 
<br/>

<br/>
When visiting a shop, restaurant or other public venue, users of the NHS COVID-19 app can scan a QR code to indicate that they've been at that location. Using the API, the NHS app checks a database to look for a match, and can inform the user if they need to self-quarantine and/or get tested if someone at the same location recorded a positive COVID-19 test result that was flagged by other means.
<br/>

<br/>
The U.K.'s National Health Service in England and Wales had planned to release an update to its app that would have asked COVID-19 positive users to upload a log of their QR code check-ins. However, according to the terms and conditions which govern Apple and Google's contact tracing API, any app that uses the API cannot collect user location data. 
<br/>

<br/>
As a result, both companies have refused to make the update available for download on their respective app distribution platforms. The previous version of the NHS app, however, remains available for download.
<br/>
<blockquote>The plan had been to ask users to upload logs of venue check-ins - carried out via poster barcode scans - if they tested positive for the virus. This could be used to warn others.
<br/>

<br/>
But the two firms had explicitly banned such a function from the start.
<br/>

<br/>
Under the terms that all health authorities signed up to use Apple and Google's privacy-centric contact-tracing tech, they had to agree not to collect any location data via the software.
<br/>

<br/>
As a result, Apple and Google refused to make the update available for download from their app stores last week and have instead kept the old version live.</blockquote>As the <em>BBC</em> notes, the NHS app has always included the ability for users to scan a QR code when visiting a public establishment. However, the code was only used to check a database that had been generated by local authorities following a viral outbreak. 
<br/>

<br/>
The now rejected update would have changed that, by asking users who had tested positive to upload their QR code checks-in to the cloud. A spokesperson for the Department of Health told the <em>BBC</em> that "The deployment of the functionality of the NHS Covid-19 app to enable users to upload their venue history has been delayed."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/covid-19-coronavirus/">COVID-19</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/exposure-notification-guide/">Exposure Notification Guide</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/apple-blocks-nhs-update-due-to-rule-breaking/">Apple Blocks Update to UK NHS Contact Tracing App for Breaking Location Data Collection Rules</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-blocks-update-to-uk-nhs-contact-tracing-app-for-breaking-location-data-collection-rules.2291425/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
