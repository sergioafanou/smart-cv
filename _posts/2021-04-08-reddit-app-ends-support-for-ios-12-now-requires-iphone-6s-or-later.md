Reddit for iOS and iPadOS now no longer supports iOS 12 and older, meaning that customers running a version of Apple's mobile operating system released more than two years ago will not be able to receive updates to the app.

Reddit announced the new change in its <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reddit/id1064216828">latest App Store update</a>, saying that "Moving forward, we will only support iOS 13.0 and above." In simpler terms, users will now need an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 6s or later to install the Reddit App following this week's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> update. Luckily, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/06/ios-14-adoption-90-percent/">majority of active iPhones and iPad devices are running iOS 14</a>, meaning the lack of support for older iOS firmware will not impact a significant amount of users.

In its &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; update, Reddit also introduced a new "double tap on images to zoom in" feature that gives users more ability to zoom into photos, much like the stock <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app on iOS and iPadOS. For users looking for an alternative to the stock Reddit app, Apollo for Reddit remains a popular choice amongst users.
