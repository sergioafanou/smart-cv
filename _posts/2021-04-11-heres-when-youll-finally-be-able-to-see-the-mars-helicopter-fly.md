Along with it, the Mars Ingenuity helicopter landed safe and sound on the Red Planet, and a significant portion of the rover's first weeks was dedicated to delivering the helicopter to its test flight location. The helicopter was deployed and has since survived several chilly Martian nights, but it has yet to take flight.</p>
<p>At present, the helicopter is scheduled to begin its flight test on April 11th, which is this coming Sunday. If that schedule holds, we won't have to wait long before we get to see the first images of the first-ever powered flight on another planet. It's an exciting time for NASA and for science fans alike, but unfortunately, we won't actually get to watch the flight happen in real-time. Instead, we'll have to wait until at least Monday, when <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-invites-public-to-take-flight-with-ingenuity-mars-helicopter">NASA plans to hold a press conference</a> to go over the data related to the flight and hopefully show off an image or two.</p>
