Dell planned a few new notebook reveals of its own for April 13th, including an upgrade to its XPS 13 flagship that fans might have been anticipating. The high-end laptop is now available with an OLED display, which is the kind of notebook upgrade we&rsquo;re expecting to go mainstream this year.</p>
<p>Samsung made a big deal <a href="https://bgr.com/tech/samsung-oled-2021-laptops-specs-14-inch-90hz-5901463/">about its OLED displays for laptops</a> in early January, teasing that various devices will ship with the upgraded screen technology. It&rsquo;s unclear, however, whether the new Dell XPS 13 rocks Samsung&rsquo;s new OLED panel, but the display upgrade will be costly regardless of what company supplies it.</p>
