<p>Smartphones are incredibly versatile devices, capable of browsing the web, running apps, taking photos/videos, conducting payments, and more. But there are times where you might want to plug your phone into an actual computer.</p>

<p>There are several reasons why you&#8217;d want to plug your phone into a computer, such as file transfers, charging, and ADB/hacking/custom ROM activities. Cloud storage has reduced the need for wired transfers somewhat, while fast charging offers exponentially faster speeds than top-ups via PC. We&#8217;ve also seen wireless ADB functionality in recent times, although you might still need a cable for some tinkering tasks.</p>
<p>Me? I used a cable within the last month or two to transfer ISOs for emulation purposes, as it&#8217;s just too tedious a process via Google Drive. And that&#8217;s really the main reason why I still plug my phone into a computer.</p>
<p>What about you? You can vote in the poll above and expand on your choice via the comments section below.</p>
