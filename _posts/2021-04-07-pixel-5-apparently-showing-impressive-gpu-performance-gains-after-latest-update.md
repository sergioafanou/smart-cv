<li>The Pixel 5 has reportedly received a major GPU performance boost with the latest update.</li>
<li>Benchmarks conducted by various testers are showing significant gains compared to previous results.</li>
</ul>

<p>Turns out the April security patch is not the only thing to look forward to in <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/april-2021-android-security-patch-1215208/">Google&#8217;s latest Pixel update</a>. Multiple reports now suggest that the Pixel 5 is exhibiting some impressive GPU performance gains after getting the new update.</p>
<p>The Snapdragon 765G-powered phone previously registered much weaker results in GPU benchmarks conducted by <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16442/the-google-pixel-5-a-minireview/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>AnandTech</em></a>. After the recent update, the publication&#8217;s reviewer Andrei Frumusanu <a href="https://twitter.com/andreif7/status/1379143336943058952" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> that performance on the Pixel 5 has &#8220;essentially doubled.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/suka_hiroaki/status/1379153849559179264">Andreas Proschofsky</a>, Editor at <em>The Standard</em>, also reran some benchmarks on the phone and noted that the results are &#8220;30-50% better&#8221; compared to what they were back in March.</p>
<p>His Pixel 5 scored around 2278/2260 on the graphic performance tests in 3DMark Sling Shot Extreme before the update. After installing the update, the phone scored 3286/3083 in the same test.</p>
<p>Of course, benchmarks don&#8217;t always translate into real-world performance. Google mentioned in its update changelog that it is introducing &#8220;performance optimization for certain graphics-intensive apps and games.&#8221; However, we haven&#8217;t found any testers mentioning specific games or apps that are functioning better owing to the update.</p>
<p>One theory that Proschofsky has is that Google probably did some kind of throttling earlier because the Pixel 5&#8217;s GPU performance was always below expected results for Snapdragon 765G phones. Folks over at <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-5-massive-gpu-performance-gains-april-2021-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>XDA Developers</em></a> are digging into what really caused the benchmark regression. We&#8217;ll update this article if and when we know more. Until then, get the update and let us know in the comments section if you notice any actual differences.</p>
