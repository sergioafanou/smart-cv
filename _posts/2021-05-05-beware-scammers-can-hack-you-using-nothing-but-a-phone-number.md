It's a gripping read, like some kind of cyber-focused John le Carre thriller -- only, you know, real -- and I can't recommend it enough.</p>
<p>However, it's also important to remember that <a href="https://bgr.com/tech/data-breach-common-hacking-techniques-for-pcs-5908449/">hackers can cause all sorts of mischief</a> without even needing to resort to the zero-days and the myriad other digital tools that they pay top dollar for, and which nation-states have used to amass frighteningly expansive hacking war chests.</p>
<p>Sometimes, all a hacker needs is your number to pull off something like a nasty yet highly effective phone scam.</p>
