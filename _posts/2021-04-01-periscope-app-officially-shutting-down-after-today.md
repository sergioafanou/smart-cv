Periscope <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/15/periscope-app-shutting-down/">first announced</a> its planned shutdown in December of 2020, and said that the app was being shuttered because most of the Periscope functionality has now transitioned to the Twitter app.
<br/>

<br/>
The Periscope app was still available un an "unsustainable maintenance-mode state" with declining usage and rising costs, and the Periscope team said that leaving the app as is wasn't "doing right by the current and former Periscope community or by Twitter."

<br/>
Periscope's core capabilities are available through Twitter, and the app has not allowed new account creation since last year. Broadcasts shared to Twitter will be available as replays, and all Periscope users will be able download an archive of broadcasts and data.
<br/>

<br/>
With the Periscope app gone, people will be able to broadcast using Twitter Live within the compose view by tapping on the in-app camera option. Brands, publishers, and creators can go live using Media Studio.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twitter/">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/periscope/">Periscope</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/31/periscope-app-officially-shutting-down-after-today/">Periscope App Officially Shutting Down After Today</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/periscope-app-officially-shutting-down-after-today.2290250/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
