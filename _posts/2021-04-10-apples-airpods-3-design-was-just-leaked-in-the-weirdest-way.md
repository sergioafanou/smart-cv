Usually referred to as AirPods 3 and AirPods Pro 2 in reports to differentiate them from the current-generation models, the new wireless earphones will probably be sold under the existing AirPods and AirPods Pro brands. These aren&rsquo;t products that get updated every year like the iPhone, so Apple isn&rsquo;t likely to use a numbering scheme for future models.</p>
<p>Naming aside, there&rsquo;s no indication of when the AirPods 3 will finally launch, but we&rsquo;ve just received more proof that Apple is working on a new pair of more affordable wireless earbuds. In a bizarre twist, counterfeiters from China released fake AirPods 3 before Apple launched the real ones, but the design is believed to be accurate.</p>
