Apple reseller Expercom is offering the first straight cash discount we've ever seen on HomePod mini, priced at <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43979&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fexpercom.com%2Fproducts%2Fhomepod-mini%3Fvariant%3D33086335778850"><strong>&#36;89.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;99.00. This is a new HomePod mini in Space Gray (White currently isn't on sale), and it has an estimated delivery in 3-7 business days.

<br/>
Ever since the HomePod mini was announced last October, all Apple resellers - and Apple itself - have continued to offer the miniature speaker at its expected retail price of &#36;99.00. So far, no other retailers have followed suit, and only Expercom has a discount on the HomePod mini.
<br/>

<br/>
Expercom offers free shipping for most orders over &#36;90, so you'll either need to add something else to the order to qualify, or pay &#36;9 in shipping.
