<li>Several OnePlus 9 Pro buyers are facing overheating problems with their phones.</li>
<li>Most people are reporting that the device heats up while using the camera app.</li>

<p>Hot off the press, the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-9-1170815/">OnePlus 9 Pro</a> is already facing some usage problems it seems. Multiple new owners of the phone are reporting instances of overheating. The complaints were spotted <a href="https://twitter.com/saravanansusair/status/1379311779596001284" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitter</a> as well as a <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/unified-oneplus-9-pro-battery-heating-and-charging-feedback-thread.1412143/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OnePlus forum thread</a>.</p>
<p>Many users are saying that their phone is heating up while using the camera app. One user, in particular, was trying to record a 4K 60fps clip but only managed to get footage worth a minute because of overheating. Another OnePlus 9 Pro owner couldn&#8217;t even take a picture in sunlight due to the overheating problem.</p>

<p>The phone&#8217;s overheating warning pops up in such scenarios, automatically blocking some functions like the camera app.</p>
<p>Some OnePlus 9 Pro owners are also noticing the problem while charging their phones. Over at <a href="https://www.amazon.in/dp/B089MV3MVY#customerReviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon India</a>, multiple verified buyers have reported similar issues. One of them said that their OnePlus 9 Pro started displaying the overheating warning before they could even finish setting up the phone.</p>
<p>In some cases, overheating problems are also resulting in severe battery drain.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear what&#8217;s causing this issue and if it affects just a small number of units or is a more widespread problem. OnePlus could possibly issue a fix through an OTA update if the overheating is happening because of some software bug. However, the company is yet to acknowledge the matter officially.</p>
