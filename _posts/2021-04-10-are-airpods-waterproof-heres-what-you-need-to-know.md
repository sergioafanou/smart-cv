<p>Unfortunately, no, your AirPods are not waterproof. Nor are they water-resistant. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether they charge wirelessly or with a lightning cable, you won&#8217;t find an IP rating of any kind. You could maybe wear them for a light workout, provided that you don&#8217;t work up too much of a sweat.</p>
<p>If you spent a little more money on the AirPods Pro, we have some slightly better news. These premium earbuds do carry an <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/ip-ratings-explained-746306/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPX4 rating</a>, which is good for sweat and light splashes of water. This makes them your top option as a workout companion, and they&#8217;ll stand up better against rain, too. However, this isn&#8217;t a suggestion that you should wear them in a torrential downpour. You probably shouldn&#8217;t wear them to shower or swim, either.</p>

<p>Finally, if you splashed the cash for the $549 <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-airpods-max-vs-bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-1202593/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AirPods Max</a>, you should know that that&#8217;s the only splashing they can handle. Apple&#8217;s most premium audio equipment ever ditches the IP rating and offers no protection from rain or dust. You&#8217;ll have to turn your attention elsewhere if you want solid cans that can handle a little water.</p>

<p>If you plan to work out regularly or you live in a wet climate, this may have just turned you off of AirPods. The good news is that you&#8217;re not out of luck. There are plenty of <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/best-waterproof-headphones-2-11663/">waterproof headphones and earbuds</a> to be had, you just have to know where to look. Samsung&#8217;s latest Galaxy Buds Pro comes with an IPX7 rating, which will stand up far better against water. The JayBird Vista true wireless earbuds are another great option, and they come with soft fins that lock in your ear.</p>

<p>You can also dig into our list of workout earbuds linked above. Most options on that list pack some degree of water resistance or at least sweat resistance to keep up in the gym. We&#8217;ve chosen options from <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/jabra-elite-85t-review-1175467/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jabra</a>, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/bose-sport-earbuds-review-1187626/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bose</a>, and more to give you a solid selection.</p>
<p>Maybe Apple will bring water resistance to its wireless earbuds in the future, but right now your best bet is to head for a third-party option.</p>
