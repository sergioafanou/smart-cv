<p>The mobile operator plans to facilitate 5G access by providing a free 5G device to any subscriber trading in an old phone. On top of that, T-Mobile is ready to upgrade 5G users to unlimited plans that included unlimited 5G access. Finally, T-Mobile launched its 5G home internet service to bring faster broadband to millions of customers, including subscribers in rural America. The latter sounds almost too good to be true, offering users a bunch of exciting perks. There are, however, a couple of caveats to consider before going this route.</p>
