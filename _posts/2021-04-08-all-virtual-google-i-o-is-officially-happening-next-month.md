<ul>
<li>Google revealed through a series of puzzles that Google I/O 2021 is happening.</li>
<li>The all-virtual event will be free and happen from May 18 through May 20, 2021.</li>
<li>We expect to see plenty of new details related to Android 12. It&#8217;s also likely we&#8217;ll see new Pixel A hardware.</li>

<p>Today, Google published <a href="https://events.google.com/io/">a new teaser page</a> filled with riddles. Once deciphered (thanks to <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/07/google-i-o-2021-has-been-announced-and-its-the-first-free-i-o-in-memory/"><em>Android Police</em></a>), the page gives some preliminary details for the next iteration of Google&#8217;s developer event, known as I/O.</p>
<p>Google canceled the I/O event in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There were rumors that it could be a stripped-back, online-only affair instead, but in the end, Google simply called the whole thing off. Google I/O 2021, though, is on and happening in that all-online format we expected in 2020.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Related:Â </strong><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-1149489/">Google buyer&#8217;s guide: Everything you need to know about Google hardware</a></p>
<p>With the event being online-only, that means it will be free for all to watch. This is a big change from previous years in which in-person events could only be attended by paid ticket holders. Just to get one of those tickets, you&#8217;d need to win a lottery-style contest. If you &#8220;won,&#8221; your ticket would have a four-figure cost.</p>
<p>We expect Google I/O 2021 to feature tons of new information related to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-12-features-1195735/">Android 12</a>. It&#8217;s also reasonable to expect new hardware launches. Google launched the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-3a-review-986460/">Pixel 3a</a> at the 2019 iteration of I/O. Had the event happened in 2020, we almost certainly would have seen the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-4a-1047299/">Pixel 4a</a> at I/O. We wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we see the expected <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-5a-1196405/">Google Pixel 5a</a> at this year&#8217;s I/O, possibly alongside the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-buds-a-1213800/">Pixel Buds A</a> (which Google&#8217;s already accidentally leaked).</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be covering the full event, so stay tuned for all the info!</p>
