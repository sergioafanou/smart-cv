Bitcoin more than tripled its 2018 high a few days ago when it topped $61,000, with other players in the business experiencing notable growth as well. The bull run is far from over, with more money pouring in, as analysts and speculators expect this to last a while longer &mdash; bitcoin was trading at around $59,500 per coin at the time of this writing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just investors making the right plays that are profiting from these massive growth periods. So are the middlemen involved in providing retail investors access to the highly coveted digital coins. Coinbase is one of the most popular crypto exchanges in the US and the world, and the company has just announced exciting plans of its own. Coinbase <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-announces-effectiveness-of-registration-statement-and-anticipated-listing-date-of-its-1509b281f760">will finally go public</a> on April 14th, trading on the NASDAQ under the COIN ticker. But the exchange is taking an unusual approach to going public that involves disclosing financial information for the first quarter of 2021.</p>
