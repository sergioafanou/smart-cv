Intel has been on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/11/intel-anti-mac-ad-campaign/">relentless marketing drive</a> against Mac computers in recent weeks, positioning them as inferior to Windows laptops powered by Intel processors. In a slight slip-up, however, Intel has accidentally used a MacBook instead of a Windows laptop in one of its newest ads to promote one of its new 11th-generation chips as "the world's best processor."

<br/>
The ad appeared on Reddit and was <a href="https://twitter.com/juneforceone/status/1379717230263300098?s=20">shared on Twitter</a> by @juneforceone, and it features a man using what clearly seems to be a MacBook Pro. The ad's tagline says, "The world's best processor on a thin and light laptop," and is meant to promote the Intel Core i7-1185G7 processor.

The image Intel uses in the ad is actually a <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/millennial-man-playing-computer-game-on-laptop-at-royalty-free-image/1222829773">stock image offered by Getty Images</a>, which clearly shows the laptop is indeed a MacBook Pro <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/mature-asian-man-playing-online-games-on-laptop-royalty-free-image/1222829782">with an accompanying Magic Mouse</a>.

<br/>
Apple continues to sell Mac computers with Intel chips, despite its ongoing transition to its own Apple silicon. But while Apple still sells Intel-based Macs, the chip referenced in the ad is not used in any Mac, and in fact, it was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/02/intel-announces-tiger-lake-chips/">launched around the same time</a> Apple released its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> Apple silicon chip late last year.

One of Intel's most notable marketing campaigns was launched last month and features former "I'm a Mac" actor Justin Long <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/justin-long-get-a-mac-intel-ad-campaign/">in a series of videos</a> comparing a MacBook Pro powered with &zwnj;M1&zwnj; to a variety of Windows laptops. Even as the two companies go head to head, newly appointed Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger says he hopes that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/intel-manufacture-apple-silicon-chips/">his company will make Apple silicon chips in the future</a> and have Apple as a normal client. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/intel/">Intel</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/07/intel-ad-stock-macbook-pro/">Intel Ad for &#039;World&#039;s Best Processor&#039; Features a MacBook Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/intel-ad-for-worlds-best-processor-features-a-macbook-pro.2290930/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
