<p>Docker is a popular open source containerization tool used to provide a portable and consistent runtime environment for software applications, while consuming less resources than a traditional server or virtual machine. Docker uses <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-a-container">containers</a>, isolated user-space environments that run at the operating system level and share system resources such as the kernel and the filesystem.</p>

<p>While other container systems exist, Docker became popular for providing a more accessible and comprehensive interface around the technology, and for creating a public repository of base container images that users can build upon when creating containerized environments to run their applications. </p>
