Apple has won the rights to a script for an hour-long drama series that will see Justin Timberlake star as former "The Gong Show" host Chuck Barris, according to <em><a href="https://deadline.com/2021/04/justin-timberlake-chuck-barris-apple-tv-series-auction-gong-show-host-cia-assassin-confessions-of-a-dangerous-mind-1234731030/">Deadline</a></em>. The untitled series will be based on "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," a 1984 memoir in which Barris claimed that hosting "The Gong Show" was a cover for his real job as a CIA assassin. Barris later admitted that he made up the story.

"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" was already adapted into a film directed by George Clooney in 2002. The new Apple TV+ series will be co-produced by Paramount Television and Miramax, the latter of which released the 2002 film.
