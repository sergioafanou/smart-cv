<li>There&#8217;s a new Kickstarter to clean your filthy earbuds.</li>
<li>Dubbed the Cardlax EarBuds Washer, it&#8217;s effectively a tiny washing machine for your audio equipment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cleaning your wax-laden <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-true-wireless-earbuds-877657/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TWS earbuds</a> can be a gross and torrid affair. But there&#8217;s a possible solution brought to the table by a new Kickstarter project. The Cardlax Earbuds Washer (via <a href="https://gizmodo.com/theres-now-a-tiny-washing-machine-to-clean-your-wax-enc-1846645372" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Gizmodo</em></a>) is an automatic pocket-sized washing machine that promises to polish and clean your buds.</p>
<p>The Earbuds Washer features a rotating soft brush attachment that first scrubs the gunk from your earbuds&#8217; orifices. Once that&#8217;s done, the main compartment packs a rotating drum surrounded by a sponge that&#8217;s &#8220;soaked with an anti-bacterial cleaning solution.&#8221; The earbuds are placed inside the drum which rotates and polishes them as it turns.</p>
<p>The Kickstarter states it should take two minutes to fully restore your earbuds. While a pair of <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-airpods-true-wireless-alternatives-925596/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AirPods</a> are the guinea pigs in the marketing material, the Earbuds Washer is also compatible with several buds from numerous brands.</p>
<p>The cleaning process uses 70% alcohol, so the project claims it&#8217;s 100% safe to use, even if your earbuds don&#8217;t sport an IP rating. Users can remove and wash the internal cleaning sponge and other internals, but you&#8217;ll probably want to completely dry it before placing it back into the machine.</p>
<p>Overall, the product seems well designed and imagined, even if it&#8217;s for a super-specific niche. That said, earbuds are growing in popularity, and so is personal hygiene amid the pandemic. The project also comes from a group that has prior Kickstarter experience, too, albeit with a credit card-sized muscle massager.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://tyvm.ly/b5NgF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cardlax Earbuds Washer</a> is available for $33 if automatic earbud cleaning is something you&#8217;re lacking in your life. The project has already quintupled its modest $5,000 goal, so it looks like this concept is in high demand. The first shipments are expected in June.</p>
