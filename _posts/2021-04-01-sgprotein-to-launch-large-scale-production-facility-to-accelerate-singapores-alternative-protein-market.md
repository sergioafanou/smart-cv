<p>SGProtein, a leading contract manufacturer of meat alternatives, has announced that it will be launching a production facility for plant-based meat companies in Singapore.</p>
<p>This development was first reported by <em><a rel="follow" rel="follow" href="https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/sgprotein-builds-southeast-asias-first-large-scale-contract-manufacturing-facility-for-meat-alternatives/">Vegconomist</a></em>.</p>
<p>With the new facility, SGProtein aims to support plant-based meat alternative companies to grow their business with R&amp;D, pilot trials and commercialisation with full flexibility. It will support food startups, multinational food manufacturers and FMCG companies.</p>

<p>The production in the facility will commence this year, with an initial capacity of over 3,000 tonnes per year, the report further said, citing sources.</p>
<p>&#8220;By manufacturing locally and at scale, brands can also significantly shorten supply chains, resulting in a much lower environmental impact and additional cost savings,&#8221; SGProtein told <em><a rel="follow" rel="follow" href="https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/sgprotein-builds-southeast-asias-first-large-scale-contract-manufacturing-facility-for-meat-alternatives/">Vegconomist</a>.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;We help innovative food startups bridge the gap between plant-based meat innovation and commercialisation. At the same time, we offer our multinational customers access to fast-growing Asian markets through a local production facility that ensures the highest standards of food safety, quality, and certification. Democratising access to the most advanced technology for meat alternatives manufacturing adds to Singapore’s attractiveness as a world-class regional hub and ecosystem,&#8221; said Riccarda Züllig, co-founder of SGProtein said.</p>
<p>SGProtein recently raised SGD$4 million (US$2.9 million) in a seed round, led by <a rel="follow" href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/khong-guan-buys-30-stake-in-plant-based-meat-alternatives-maker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biscuit maker Khong Guan</a> to further accelerate the sustainable food market in <a class="stylish-link" rel="follow" href="https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/singapore-emerges-as-the-food-tech-ecosystem-of-asia/">Singapore.</a></p>
<p>Conscious consumption or a more healthy way of diet has been the driving trend in the foodtech sector for the last five to ten years, according to <em><a rel="follow" rel="follow" rel="follow" href="https://medium.com/venture-beyond/exploring-the-2020-foodtech-sector-83b3960382b9" rel="follow">White Star</a></em><a rel="follow" rel="follow" rel="follow" href="https://medium.com/venture-beyond/exploring-the-2020-foodtech-sector-83b3960382b9" rel="follow"> <em>Capital </em></a><em>study.</em></p>
<p>This is largely due to a shift in people’s values of food consumption, towards a healthier lifestyle.</p>
<p>According to <em><a rel="follow" rel="follow" rel="follow" href="https://medium.com/venture-beyond/exploring-the-2020-foodtech-sector-83b3960382b9" rel="follow">Pitchbook</a></em>, a company providing private market data, a significant chunk of the market share will be taken away from the US$350-billion annual meat market.</p>
<p>Food innovation and bio-engineered food have been predicted to continue growing annually by 10 per cent with the possibility of reaching US$104.6 billion by 2025,</p>
